He says he feels better when he's on his gummies than when he's not and they last well over 8 hours, just in time for the second dose.

       "top     My son is diagnosed with severe ADHD, ASD, autism and has defiant behaviors which are very unbearable. Someone directed me to myco_ebby on IG. Now my son has been on the full spectrum THC free cbd gummies for about two months. No side effects. He eats like a champ and even sleeps great, there’s been improved focus and the meltdowns barely happen. It's worked really well for him. He says he feels better when he's on his gummies than when he's not and they last well over 8 hours, just in time for the second dose. Before that, we had tried Vyvanse and Strattera with poor results and lots of side effects. We get it from myco_ebby on insta, it’s worth a shot.  \n",

      "727  My husband, Tim Sitar is leaving me because of my mental health. I have panic attacks, I have anxiety I have borderline personality, disorder, depression. ￼ and this is all from growing up in an alcoholic family. I did everything I could to try to explain to him but he didn’t want any part of it. I’m nobody I’m not a therapist I’m just a person who’s been to therapy most of my life, but I think he’s a narcissist and I think I made a good mark for him my husband before Tim died. I didn’t see anyone for five years and let me tell you he charmed me and charmed me and charmed me. I think it’s called love bombing and I fell for it. I’m not sad because he’s leaving North Carolina and going back to New York. I’m sad because my little dog Jazzy really liked him and we are in a separation. In North Carolina you have to wait a year of separation and then you can file for divorce so he used to come over to my apartment just to help me out, bring things trying to make himself look like a good guy. But it breaks my heart because my dog hears people coming up and down the stairs and she thinks it’s Tim and she whines and whines and wines and I try to tell her that he’s never coming back just breaks my heart. ￼ nor do I want him to come back.

      "3590  17 Things Your ADHD Child Would Tell You if He Could\\n\\n1) I'm trying way harder than you’ll ever know even though it doesn’t seem like it to you. I really, truly am.\\n\\n2) Criticizing me or getting angry at me that my brain doesn’t work better doesn’t help me. It makes me hate myself even more.\\n\\n3) I’m painfully aware of all the areas that I’m not measuring up. Instead of making a big deal about my shortcomings, try to find ways to help me.\\n\\n4) An accommodation isn’t the same as enabling. If you help me where I’m genuinely struggling, I’m going to be grateful. Don’t assume that I’m manipulating you.\\n\\n5) I’m not doing this to you; it’s not something I am doing on purpose.\\n\\n6) If you think it’s hard to live with me, imagine trying to live inside a body that won’t do what you want it to do.\\n\\n7) My brain doesn’t work right but I don’t know how to tell you that. It makes me angry and unkind, but I’m not trying to be that way.\\n\\n8) When I’m being horrible, what I really need is for you to tell me you’ll love me no matter what. And maybe hug me, too. I probably believe that I’m unlovable, so prove me wrong.\\n\\n9) I know that my lack of motivation is frustrating, but pushing harder doesn’t help me do better.\\n\\n10) My anger and frustration is a result of my brain not processing properly. When I’m overwhelmed and freaking out, don’t escalate by freaking out or getting angry too. I need you to be calm and show me that everything’s going to be fine even when I feel like it’s not.\\n\\n11) If I get overwhelmed, don’t expect me to sort out the problem all by myself. The part of my brain the controls regulation doesn’t work properly. That’s why I need your help to regulate.\\n\\n12) Don’t try to break me of things that you see as weaknesses. My sensitivity as a child means I’ll be compassionate as an adult. My stubbornness as a child means I’ll be independent and assertive as an adult. Instead of squashing these characteristics, channel them toward something good that can benefit me when I’m older. Don’t view me as something that needs fixed or toughened-up.\\n\\n13) Don’t be afraid of labeling me. A label gives me answers and help. If my condition is serious enough to need to be diagnosed, you can guarantee that I’ve noticed something’s wrong and I’m wondering why I’m different too. Unless you tell me what’s going on, I’m likely to grow up angry and confused about why everyone has it all together and I don’t. A label means I can get help; it gives me answers and vindication.\\n\\n14) I have a real, actual medical condition in my brain. It’s just as real as if I had Type 1 Diabetes. Just like Diabetes, I need help to deal with the condition. No one tells someone with Type 1 Diabetes that they are lazy if they’re tired because their blood sugar is low. They understand that it’s part of the condition. Please, please, please learn about my condition, and don’t blame me for things that are out of my control. Just like leaving Type 1 Diabetes untreated results in serious complications and even death, untreated ADHD can lead to serious complications –potentially including death. Thankfully, there are many ways to treat ADHD (and medication isn’t the only way).\\n\\n15) My frontal lobe is developing 30% behind normal. Please understand this and don’t put me in situations I’m not ready to handle. If you give me responsibility that’s beyond my developmental age, don’t be angry with me that I do poorly. That’s setting me up for failure, and that’s just cruel.\\n\\n16) Stop expecting me to be normal. I can’t be. Not for all my trying. Until you accept that, I’ll always be a failure in your eyes, and I’ll always view myself as not good enough.\\n\\n17) You have the power to make me miserable by how you treat me. Remember to treat me with love and grace. Treat me how you would want to be treated if you were struggling with a problem in your brain. I may make myself miserable sometimes, but don’t add to that by treating me poorly. When in doubt, be kind. Believe me, I need your kindness.   \n",

My best guess is to focus on multi-platform news like LBC radio. This essentially provides a balance view. Anyhow, the more we communicate with each other the better. This also provides the opportunity to gain a balanced view. Let's support each other through this. :)  \n",
