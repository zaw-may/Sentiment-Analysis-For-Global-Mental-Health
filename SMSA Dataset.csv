I feel like I‚Äôm a burden to everybody  bothering people with my problems & my existence. Moving to a different city & changing my number have been heavy on my mind.,Best to talk to a therapist. It's too much for family and friends,"I hear you.... I do. I want to do the same sometimes. But then I watch people and see who they are because I know I have a mental issue and I know my brain lies to me... Look around you.... Some people really do care.

Maybe go to weekly mind meetings in the UK or groups local to you who all feel the same xxx"
This is what I'll be doing on Christmas. I just do not feel well. I just do not have it in me to fight  I've been doing it for 55 years. I'm just worn out. I do hope your Christmas will be better.,Give yourself a break from your negative thoughts. This is the day  the king is born.,Same here. I know how you feel
Bye big hugs blessed be judge me all you want don't care.  After tonight my spouse thinks he's so wonderful well let's me make it real!!,I'm okay but mentally I'm not and I'm done putting up with all this...i will be okay when I disappear not dead just gone!! I've seriously had enough.  Thank you all for caring I do greatly appreciate it more than I can even express!,Are you OK?
I know this may be deemed a silly question but it's in my nature to ask  how is everyone feeling? Let's start a discussion.,Restless. I personally think there's something else going on.,"I agree it's so hard to know what to know what to believe. The media have reputation of skewing the truth by means of escalating small amounts of truth. My best guess is to focus on multi-platform news like LBC radio. This essentially provides a balance view. Anyhow, the more we communicate with each other the better. This also provides the opportunity to gain a balanced view. Let's support each other through this. :)"

"As I type this slowly from my hospital bed. I suffer from depression and anxiety for over 26 years. In September I caught a cold. Though it was bronchitis, also during this time my physician has me on thyroid meds I don't need. Which in turns sends me into go get a bunch of tests done. Well quess what thyroid was just fine. This was NNovember15. November 19 I end up in the er. Can't walk, slurred speech, and numbing on my left side of my face. I have the ct scans,labs,mri. They can't find anything, so they just say follow up with your doctor. The soonest I could get in was Dec 8th. My doctor then diagnosed me with viral encephalitis. No test to confirm that was it. Starts me on anti-virus meds, and then weeks later steroids. I bring to January 10th back in er. I look like I had a stroke!!! It's time to do a spinal tap and a full mri!

Guess who's labs came clean and mri. Neurologist told that the depression and anxiety took my brain. It was like the check engine light was flashing, and I didn't see it. So now I have to lean how to walk again,talk,you know the simple things in life. I will never be the same person again. And I have to cope with that. But I hope sharing my story with you all helps someone else that feels lost.",Sounds very much like conversion disorder. I hope you get well soon...,"!!!UPDATE!!!
I am out of the hospital and at home. I have outpatient pt/ot scheduled to help with my symptoms. But at least I am home and I can have my support animals back. Thank you everyone for your kindness and advice. And also thank you for welcoming me to the group!"

"Just wanted to say you not alone and my inbox is always open if you struggle or just want to vent 
I struggle myself I know how it's feels when you have no one to talk.","I once believed that my beloved spouse was the epitome of perfection. Little did I know, beneath her charismatic facade, she was a master manipulator, distorting reality to satisfy her own selfish desires. Lost and disoriented, I desperately yearnedfor a glimpse of the truth. Then, by chance, I stumbled upon a mysterious expert online. Desperate for answers, I sought out his assistance, and it turned out to be a life-changing revelation! With his unmatched skills, he fearlessly delved into the intricate web of deceit, monitoring my wife's actions through her phone and covertly examining her WhatsApp conversations. That was the moment when my world crumbled. I discovered that my beloved wife had been secretly meeting with young individuals, betraying me without remorse. The anguish I felt was indescribable, amplified by the realization of the abuse and silent suffering I had endured. It was a harsh awakening that left me shattered. But I refuse to let this story end in despair. As a survivor of such treacherous depths, I urge you, esteemed reader, to pay heed to my narrative. Countless individuals find themselves trapped in similar webs of deception, living in the shadows of manipulative narcissists. That is why I wholeheartedly recommend the elusive guru who unraveled my truth. If you too desire to reclaim your reality, don't hesitate to reach out to him. The key to liberation is within your grasp. Connect with him on his Facebook page, üëâ Sift Forensics and embrace the power of truth to break free from the clutches of deception.

"Its urgent. Im not feeling well. I had mild depression for a week now. But now it is a full blown major depressive episode. It all precipitated when i asked my newly married sister, who i am very close with, that i wanted to visit her and idk she didnt sound very eager to welcome me (or atleast thats what i perceived). I hung up and I stopped answering her calls and messages. I dont feel good at all. I have nobody to talk to.",I think the answer is within your own Words... As you know we all have Our own problems going on and maybe they have their own also and Are thinking of you and if you visiting would make you feel worse... Talk to them stop avoiding them if you want to feel better,"1. Once married things are different. 
2. Her lack of eagerness could be because of other issues irrelevant to you.
3. What if you talked to her and asked if she had a problem or something going on."
"I need advice 

Befofe you accuse me of me being gross accuse past me cause I lost touch with this person for two years now but I can‚Äôt help but think back on it cause it was such a silly and possibly disgusting thing 

So two years ago I was friends with someone on discord 

We originally met on messenger with our bond over anime 

She was 17 and I was 25 and you do the math of how old we are today 

Eventually our friendship grew strong before the fall 

But the age difference was very off putting not just number but mind wise 

Yes we‚Äôd have fun having discord watches with watching animes and cartoons cuz we bond over those but yet we‚Äôd fight a lot 

I still cant believe up to this day I was friends with a minor‚Ä¶ 

Was I gross and disgusting committing this act? 

Be real 

Cause like I wanna know 

I think I was 

But I‚Äôm curious what other people think 

Like there was nothing innapropriate we were just silly and bonding over anime and cartoons",So this person was a friend no big deal wot so ever,10 year's up 10 year's down is my limit  but we are all different and should make our own rules so what i say is not what you say so 95 year old and 15 year old is correct to what they say .

"So I get to speak to a new doctor tomorrow and I am hoping they listen. I was told I have BPD aswell as a whole bunch of other stuff but I think it's something different like bipolar. 
There is no medium with me. I am extremely high and then extremely low. I get very defensive when I am high which is a natural reaction I have. My other problem is alcohol because I have used it as a coping mechanism and it has destroyed me in the process. I am going to ask for medication for that too. If I had money I would walk away from the life I have now and hope that a fresh start would help me be better and save the heartache I cause to those around me. But that isn't the answer.","Have you tried AA groups? It could help with the alcohol and maybe help with symptoms from the mental health diagnosis.

,I was in your place a long time ago all I can say God was watching over me and he is watching over you it took a lot of therapy a lot of tears it has been a long road but guess what it got better it doesn‚Äôt seem like that now but you will too get people around you family or friends that will support you,A lot of good causes out there to help others
"Mom here of a 25 Bipolar son, he has been hospitalized since Saturday after a car accident due to drugs and manic episode.  

Got a call today from nurse. Asking me questions regarding my son's mental health history.  
One question or comment upset me. 

She asked if my son was abused, he claimed he was abused by me physically.  I started to cry, it broke my heart to think his mind is so sick righr now that he is accusing me of abuse. 
I never abused my son, me turning off the wi-fi was the worse thing I have ever done. He never gave me a reason to hit him or even yell at him till he was abour 17 yrs old. 

My heart hurts for him and i am sad üòî","Ehh 
In some cases people can imagine things that are not real. Can even place them precisely in their lifetime.

"OK tell me if this sounds crazy but my daughter sees hears ans feels things in her room she's always saying she hears voices in her head ... I was cleaning her room tonight before she comes home tomorrow ans her dog was up there with me and she started wagging her tail ans cocking her head like someone was talking to her. .
Could it be possible my daughter isn't hearing voices in her head but it's the spirits or whatever she's hearing seeing and feeling ?",Get a medium in your home and they will tell you for sure,"Absolutely! It's entirely possible that your daughter is perceiving the presence of spirits or entities in her room. Children are often more sensitive to energies and can pick up on things that adults may not be aware of. The wagging tail and cocking of the head by her dog could indicate that there was indeed some form of communication happening. If you're open to exploring this further, you may consider reaching out to a spiritual counseling expert or a psychic medium who can help you understand and navigate these experiences. They can provide guidance on how to support your daughter and address any concerns you may have."

Hes hitting his addiction hard. Hes says he pushes people away and doesn't mean it, but the stuff he say hurts me so bad like he doesn't want to be with me.

Be safe stay strong make a  safety plan","Advocate for self-care practices, like getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring joy. These small steps can have a positive impact on mental health."
"For once my life is going reasonably well , so why am I feeling as flat as a pancake, spending to much and eating to much ! Ug !","Well think you hit the nail on the head there with eating.....  Eating is a habit, and a lot of the time, an emotional habit. Our lives may be going well but as your post suggests, your life 'usually' doesn't go well...so even tho it's ok now, you're just waiting for the downturn to reappear, hence the (possible) anxious, comfort eating. And that's a perfectly normal response. 

If you were to analyse and recognise, that is what you are doing, and you understand it is NOT because you are hungry - then you can take steps to change that eating habit. 

Maybe put your shoes on and walk around the garden a few times, or to the end of the street and back, or start to jog...

It is well recognised that there is a link between mental health and physical well-being, and when we suffer mentally we don't exercise as much or take care of our bodies needs. By doing just 20 minutes of walking where you're not on your phone, or walking to the shops or pick the kids up - will increase your physical well-being and help you gain confidence in your decisions and life choices, and of course, just help you feel good in those moments when things are going well ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π","After long time stress situations your body need more food due the fact he has been over loaded and it is normal to fill flat ,  becaause you over worked mentally your body need regain energy"

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Because I was on holiday when the changes happened and I‚Äôm normally the one who does the changes that management want to make so it doesn‚Äôt effect me as much because I‚Äôve done it but since coming back I just want to leave because I can‚Äôt cope with the changes. I‚Äôve never ever felt like this before but it‚Äôs actually making me feel sick that I don‚Äôt know where anything belongs anymore! Can anyone give any support on this?","My advice is to communicate to your directors that the layout of the room and your ability to positively control the environment is foundational to your role.

I would communicate respectfully that it is stressful having the environment in a state of flux.  

Many people perform better in a static, rather than dynamic workplace, so don't be too hard on yourself.  I think this is a common experience among people.

I can empathize.  I've felt this way before.

Last bit of advice is concentrate on the kiddos and the things you can control.

Don't ruminate on the things you can't control and ultimately, remember that control is an illusion.","Agree that communication will be central, and I also found it interesting that you mentioned you hadn't felt like this before. Is there anything else going on for you at the moment? Or have you have a negative experience with change in the past?"

"Do you see the girl rotating clockwise or counterclockwise? Answer in comments.

Answer below: üëá

If you see the girl rotating clockwise, then you are using the right hemisphere of your brain at the moment, and vice versa.

The right hemisphere represents people with artistic flair. The left hemisphere instead is linked to rationalism and generally organized mathematical thinking.

"Hi all.
Does anyone have a fear of chemicals aswell as germs? I'm terrified of poisoning myself accidentally","These irantional fears can be the product of maladaptive coping mechanisms brought on by society's influence, or rather misinfluence.

Chemicals are of rational concern as are germs, however the problem arises when these concerns become irrational and seriously affects our daily lives.

Try to Remember~

1.) Our body is an amalgamation of chemicals.

2.) Human cells make up only 43% of the body's total cell count. The rest are microscopic colonists.  (according to the BBC)

3.) Moderate germ exposure boosts the immune system in most cases.  The history of vaccines shows this to be fundamentally true.

Lastly I'm not sure if rationalizing a (partially) irrational fear is helpful or hurtful.

If it is hurtful, I apologize for my ignorance and wish you the best.

"Got back in touch with my mum this year, my dad died last year and I decided to work on forgiveness for my mum but yesterday she gaslit me, it took me some hours to figure out what had happened and gain some regulation back because it was about something serious that happened in the past. 

It caught me by surprise, really upset me and I've had vivid dreams last night relating to it. It was an attack basically, ok so I've accepted I'm not going to get accountability from her and that our relationship is very limited because of her lies, I've figured that next time I speak to her I put some very strong boundaries in. 

I've read not to pull a narcissist up on lies as they will attack more but we can't let them get away with it surely, what would be the best way to approach it? Any ideas welcome..","You‚Äôll never move forward with anything if you‚Äôre letting the past ruin today. You can‚Äôt change her, so either change your mindset or realize the relationship just won‚Äôt work. Go ahead and set the boundaries you want and see if she is willing to respect them. She sounds similar to my mom and I know that wouldn‚Äôt work with mine. I had to just tell her how I felt and forgave her for her actions towards me, but had to leave the relationship. Forgiveness isn‚Äôt based on the other individual, it‚Äôs solely based on you.","As rational.humans, we need to make sense of everything and we need to rationalise and put all our ducks in a row. And then we need to go back and revisit our own timelines and rectify and reorder the past thinking it will give us peace, or closure, or that it will help us make sense of our lives somehow...

Unfortunately life is not a well written book nor a well produced film. We have chapters badly written and scenes that don't play out as we would like. There is no rewrite or edit available unfortunately. 

The biggest peace for you will come with acceptance of this fact. You need to find your peace before you visit the past with anyone, otherwise you will always be unsettled. 

I tried to have a proper relationship as an adult with my estranged dad. But it didn't matter what I had achieved, he wouldn't acknowledge what I had done was anything special - built a multi 7 figure business, performed close up magic for the original members of Iron Maiden and probably the biggest actress on the planet, and now as a Hypnotherapist transforming mental health and physical well-being. 

Now at 77 he still has trouble engaging on a close personal level.

I realised a long time ago that it was his issue not mine. It hurt to cut him off and stop trying to reach him, or talk about the things I would like to share with a parent...

But I still visit him every month or two and the subjects we talk about are limited, and I'm ok with that, and I'm not sure he even notices. 

So find your peace - u can't change that person but you can change how a person affects you. 

Good luck ü•∞"
"TW: Suicide.

Just to get it out of the way, so people don‚Äôt ask about it, yes, I see a therapist. Yes, I see a psychologist. Yes, I‚Äôm on medication.

*Now onto the meat of it all:
I‚Äôve been going through a major depressive episode. About a week ago, it all came to a T, and I (28F) tried to hurt myself. I had a knife hidden in my dresser drawer and I was using it on myself. My husband (32M) walked in on me, and took the knife. As I said, it was a bad, bad day. I really wanted to be done with it all, so I was screaming at him to give it back.

Without my knowledge (I was focused on other things. I truly didn‚Äôt know), he took 9 audio recordings of me yelling for the knife and then sent them to his mother, who lives over 1600 miles away, and couldn‚Äôt help even if she tried. Somehow, those recordings ended up in the hands of my BIL who is a cop where they live.

He called the cops in our town, ‚Äúanonymously‚Äù reporting a domestic dispute involving a deadly weapon. (I did end up in the behavioral health hospital after this, so please don‚Äôt comment that I need inpatient treatment. I got it and was released.) That all is how I found out about the recordings in the first place.

Since my return home, he‚Äôs been telling me he loves me, wants to connect, wants to help, etc., but tonight, I found out that he‚Äôs been exchanging text messages with everyone who was involved in the situation (we have an open-phone policy that goes both ways), and deleting the messages afterward. Fine. I wish he‚Äôd read my mind and known that I‚Äôd want us both to have some space from all of this, but he didn‚Äôt. Not his fault. So I asked that he not exchange messages with the people involved in this extremely traumatic experience for the time being, while I try to heal and let some of the anger I have toward the situation go (something I‚Äôm working on in therapy). He essentially told me no. What he actually said is that I can‚Äôt have control over who he talks to, but that translates to ‚Äúno‚Äù in my book.

He completely betrayed my trust by recording me without my knowledge. He betrayed my trust by sending those recordings out. He betrayed my trust by hiding the recordings from me until circumstances forced my knowledge, and now he is betraying me by remaining in contact with the people involved.

On top of it all, since my return home, he‚Äôs deleting all of his text communications with everyone involved (we have an ‚Äúopen-phone policy - he can use my phone whenever, and I, his), claiming it‚Äôs a habit, or his phone is low on storage, or that he knows I‚Äôll find something to be upset about in the messages, so he‚Äôs doing me a favor by getting rid of them.

And now he just keeps repeating that I sound paranoid, which he knows is a huge fear of mine, especially being prime-age for a psychotic/schizophrenic break.

I feel I have the right to be distrustful, but I also feel paranoid.

TLDR; my husband (32M) audio-recorded me (28F) trying to get a knife from him so that I could hurt myself, and sent those recordings out to his family, leading to the police being called. I get out of inpatient hospitalization, and he‚Äôs deleting all his text messages and being really touchy about his phone (we have an open-phone policy that goes both ways).","This sounds like a really tough experience for you. And it sounds like despite the possibility of paranoia, there's substantial evidence to show why you feel you can no longer trust this person.

Just wanted to check, did you have a question? Did you want some advice? Or did you just want to feel heard?","As someone who has recently been in a very similar situation (my son's Dad tried to take his own life 2 weeks ago) it sounds as though your husband was just trying to help. It sounds like he was recording you as it was easier than trying to explain to someone in words what was going on. During the last 2 weeks I have spent a lot of time on the phone and messaging the police, the hospital, and my ex's friends and family. I wouldn't especially want him to read the messages as I think it could upset him. However, they were just updates for everyone involved on the situation and I was doing it to try to help. I hope things improve for you soon. Xx"

"Joined the group because nobody is answering my calls and I feel like I'm dying a little. I disowned my sister today. Our brother died in 2010 so I now have no siblings left. To give you the gist I've been going through what I can only describe as a nuclear custody war over my 3 1/2 year old daughter since she turned 1. I had 50/50 custody after a little bit of difficulty reaching a mediation agreement. She came back about a year after we split and the ""reconciliation"" was an absolute dumpster fire. Doing the right thing, buckling down and working hard, being on a self improvement and spiritual journey and fighting for my daughter and the woman I used to love, it yielded no results. I was left feeling the way I did before when pur relationship started to fail. I felt ignored, used, unappreciated, and not really even treated like a person. She did get arrested twice for domestic battery against me. She's made up lies of violent threats to get an emergency custody order, so now i have to pay $60 an hour to see my daughter 3 hours a week and try to make every minute count, do all of the things I have to do as a father to make my daughter grow. I didn't see her for 9 months before we reunited. My daughter is hurting to have her dad around more. I hurt with her. I constantly feel helpless. My arm is broken because I was attacked with a baseball bat so I'm struggling to get back to work as a carpenter. I have to wear my cast for 2 more weeks. Financially struggling from being out of work. Today I got mad at my sister because I saw her doing business transactions with my ex on venmo and I felt like she was breaking bread with the enemy. I called her out. In a nutshell she said I don't know what real parenting is, called me a deadbeat and says I'm a drunk who never stepped up for his daughter. Made up some stories that I was always passing her off to my mom and dad so I could go out and get drunk. I've struggled with the bottle, but I've always been a good sober and present dad. I just can't believe my only living sister thinks so low of me and sides with my ex. It's a dagger in my heart. I had to disown her as my sister. I can't speak to her ever again.

I try and block them out with music. There is cruel ppl out there bt you will get through this and you can be you again.
"Hi just joined this group as everything is just seeming a little bit much at the moment.  I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm over thinking and my brain has just given up of if it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm actually dealing with a little too much. 
This may not be the right place to be posting. I think this may be more of emotional of trauma group thing. But here goes. I feel like I‚Äôm literally about to lose my shit.
I apologise this is going to be a long post! 
I‚Äôm a single, unemployed mum to an almost 18 (m) year old and a 12(f) year old. Have been a full time career for my youngest as she has a life limiting condition (cf) She was doing very well until recently when she decided that she would only take her very much needed medication when it suited her! Having constant battles with that. And I‚Äôm trying all kinds of bribery and punishments to get her to take it. Some days I‚Äôm on the verge of forcing it down her throat. Plus she‚Äôs hit puberty and periods so is sometimes just difficult for the sake of it. 
My oldest is non binary, (born male) and in a relationship with someone who is also non binary (born female) recently found out they are having sex. Was a bit of a shock as they are only ever together at my house. And they had a pregnancy scare a couple of weeks ago. They are using condoms but i am trying very much to get the ‚Äògirl‚Äô booked into clinic to get the pill. They live with grandparents who refuse to accept the non binary situation so are looking to me to take them on to the clinic. They are at my house EVERY  Saturday, without fail. Grandad is apparently blissfully ignorant to any goings on. 
They were planning on moving into my house together when they finished college, then dropped the bomb shell ON MY BIRTHDAY! That actually they are planning on moving away for
Uni to flat share with someone else! 

Bear with me it gets better. I dated a much younger man a few years ago, I was 35. He was 21. It got very dark and disturbing quite quickly. I ended it after 8 wks. Tried to stay friends, because I was friends with his mum and brothers. He burnt me with a lighter. Then pinned me in a kitchen screaming at me whilst my kids were there crying. That was me done completely! He then stalked me for 8 mths, watching me from his bedroom window. until he started dating one of my closest friends. We all live on the same street. She got engaged to him, had a baby with him and it‚Äôs a been a volatile relationship from the beginning. To my knowledge he‚Äôs never physically hurt her, but he emotionally abuses her all the time and tries to pin her into situations. Which I end up having to deal with. She‚Äôs often sat in my house crying and asking what she should do. Despite my advice she goes back to him. Until this week. She‚Äôs ended it and is (ü§û) refusing to go back . I went through a lot of trauma getting out of my relationship with him. I almost left a house I love to be gone from him. She‚Äôs now in the same situation. 
I really want to support her taking this stand against him, but it‚Äôs only been a week and I‚Äôve had 17 phone calls, 8 visits, more msgs than I can count and an add to a very toxic group msg group. I‚Äôm already so angry to the point that I want to take a bat to his head and my kids are back to being worried to leave the house if he‚Äôs in the street. 
She suffers with her mental health already and has a teen daughter that also does. 
So do I support her and just put boundaries in place so that she doesn‚Äôt affect my kids mental health (which as much as I love her, I think she‚Äôll struggle to follow) or do I just cut off all ties?","Dr_good_tripz on instagram saved my life.

How do you move forward after a mental abusive relationship. And trust someone again. How do you build that confidence back . I feel like my life is slipping by because of my past . It‚Äôs hard to let go of what the abuse has done to you,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time after an abusive relationship. Healing from that kind of trauma takes time and effort, but please know that you're not alone in this journey. It's completely natural to feel like your past is holding you back, but remember that your past doesn't define your future.

Seeking professional help from a therapist who specializes in trauma can be incredibly beneficial. They can provide you with the guidance and tools to navigate through the emotions and challenges you're facing. Building back your confidence and trust will take time, but it's possible.

Surrounding yourself with supportive friends, family, or support groups can make a huge difference. And don't be afraid to take small steps toward rebuilding your self-esteem. Setting boundaries, practicing self-care, and focusing on your strengths can gradually help you regain a sense of control and stability.

Healing isn't linear. There will be ups and downs, but each step you take toward healing is a victory. Be patient with yourself and know that you deserve happiness and a healthy, fulfilling life moving forward.",Be  by yourself  you don't need a man find yourself

So earlier today i get another phone call from the mht ( mental health team ) according to the the woman i was talking to she said I'm still getting my phone appointment on Friday but they might suggest group therapy then I go ur fkn kidding me she goes no so i go ur telling me that you want some1 who hears voices every waking moment of every day and who has suicidal thoughts and hallucinations wen there around people for to long to do group therapy i was fuming i said I'm not going to do group therapy bcus that takes between 60 - 90 minutes she goes pretty much i go fk no that's way too long for me to be around people i said so u think that's going to work wen u know what will happen i said are you high she said there is no reason to be rude i said rude where was u last year wen I needed u wen my gp ( doctor ) tried to refur me bk to u and u said no 3 fkn times üò° i also said that they've known wots been going on with me for years and haven't done anything apart from trying to get me to do group therapy like that's going to help bcus its not üò° i can bearly be around people for to long thats why wen i go shopping im not out for long bcus im not.,"Yeah I was offered group therapy, they said if I did group therapy and it didn't work, I'd be automatically placed onto one to one therapy, however if I didn't go on group therapy there's at least 2-3 month waiting list for one to one. I explained that I didn't want strangers knowing my business that can tell others. So I've had to wait",Being part of a great solution that tackles MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES is definitely STRATEGIC.

Hi I would like to have some kind  people to talk I'm a little lonely at the moment my boyfriend mostly works and I'm home alone pretty much and iv got mental health issues and struggling alot getting regular migraines constant mood swings and anxiety has gotten alot worse I don't like going out at all I'm house bound I worry going out because I get people giving me dirty looks or walking by laughing at me and my boyfriend won't defend me by telling them to stop so I started staying home as I feel the best solution I don't want to argue with mean people out there I put weight on and iv got very skinny eyebrows and I think that is why they are giving me the odd looks but it goes to show that people are sexist and care to much about how other women look if I was slim and I had thick eyebrows they wouldn't be looking at me strange I know exactly why there doing it but I don't agree with the reasons so many people are big it's nothing unusual or out of the ordinary but I think people have this perception that women should have a particular body shape and if your big or medium they will treat you differently and not respect you all these behaviours from people have escalated I don't think my mental health will improve if I don't stop getting bullied it's easy for people to want mentally ill people to get well but what if Ur bullied or have certain toxic people in Ur life,"Hi there.  I'm sorry you are feeling so low. Have you any friends at all you can invite round to your house seeing as your boyfriend works?  Are you able to start an activity hobby either at your house, a business making or selling or leave the house for a class I.e mexican cookery, art etc or is your mental health stopping that?

Have you got the motivation  within you to follow any exercise programme at home to make your metabolism higher and feelgood factor and proud of yourself for sticking to a plan? 

Just ideas but good luck x","Blessed Be to you and hugs. It isn't easy feeling alone and going through mental health issues where you also feel the whole world is judging you.  Know you are not alone and you are loved even though it doesn't feel like it.  Reaching out is a major step and you should take that into account as you move forward to feel better.  Everyone is different and unique in there own way and our situations are different and our society has the tendency to group us all together in all ways which is horrible.  But you will be okay and things will get better.  I talk to a therapist once a week and lately I've been going through an extremely depressed state to the point of almost having another nervous breakdown which I'm desperately trying to avoid.  And you know sometimes all it takes is even a caring stranger to talk to you to help you snap out of a mood or at least get you moving in the right direction to seek more help. I will also say this and it may sound harsh but this comes from personal experience....you are f ing beautiful just the way you are and don't EVER let this dysfunction society make you feel like how there making you feel!! Forget them they look at you funny hold your head up higher...I'm not saying be mean or judgemental of others I'm saying gather that self esteem...do things that make you happy and make you feel proud of yourself. Example me...I won't ever stop changing my hair...my color my hair style or cut no matter what anyone thinks and I won't stop jamming out to my music singing dancing even if it looks or sounds funny.  My job yeah it's just a job but at the same time it's my time to make things clean and disinfected and do good feel good about what I accomplished all the whole listening either to music or my audible stories (I'm a cleaner).  My point...you are you believe in yourself do things that you enjoy or love...learn to ignore whatever people may think...if you want to change something about yourself do that for you not anyone else. I myself consistently talks to myself in the mirror and I answer myself (weird but helpful) and there is nothing wrong with that it's one of my coping skills since I really don't have anyone else I can vent to none of us have an on call therapist.  My music, my audible stories, art, singing, poetry, nature all things I use for coping and yeah sometimes they don't always work but then I find something else to add to my list or I have a huge cry.  Anyway, you got this and I swear this society of ours is set on making us miserable on purpose... DON'T Let THEM! I 40 years old and have been going through crap my whole life and yes I am far from perfect and I have meltdowns and seriously messed up moments but you know what I keep coming back too...This too shall pass! You got this blessed be to you and big hugs!"
"So when you realize you're trauma bonded to a narcissist and addicted to the abuse cycles and you know the dangers of staying in the relationship and have left and lost so much over 18 months, and you leave, how do you get past that nagging urning to see them and speak to them again? How have you guys successfully maintained no contact without giving in? I think I probably need some therapy. But any other ideas are definitely welcomed. I'm so tired of this game and I want out.

He has fallen through someone‚Äôs skylight because he was believed she was in there. He is running through woods etc trying to catch her up. 
He has now said he needs help he cannot go on like this. So I took him to hospital 7pm on Tues night. They put us in a side room  with a chair till 4pm Wednesday afternoon. They then put him in another side room with a chair till Wednesday night. Finally got a bed at 10pm in the main hospital, not a mental health hospital. He is still there. He is doing all he can not to kick off because his head is telling him to do loads of stuff he shouldn‚Äôt be in a normal hospital. He has no mental health people checking on him.

I have been struggling the majority of my life. It's been extremely bad the last year. In the last 3 months I gave up twice but was brought back. I'm trying so hard to find that joy.. fire.. passion that kepted me going before and it seems like no matter what I do or how hard I try it's not good enough or I create more damage etc etc. It's taking alot of strength that I'm surprised I'm finding to  even make this post trying to see what more I can do.

Hi I'm struggling. I'm having nightmares. My daughter got beat up by her dad last year.  Her dad is looking at prison or probation. So I'm pissed that my parents are praying he gets the charges dropped. When I was a kid I was raped and they did the same thing.  The bastard walked. I just don't understand how they could do this to their own daughter and granddaughter. It makes me so mad. My anxiety is high. These nightmares are the worst. Could use some hugs.

"My mental health is destroying me. 
I've always struggled I've been through alot of trauma (witnessed DV as a child to an alcoholic father,I became a single mum at 17 to a baby who has complex needs,ended up in a DV relationship myself abused in every way,lost permanent care of my daughter who has been adopted(she turns 13 this month),I've been in my current relationship for almost 10years,he's had his own issues and sadly relapsed in Sept 2021(no abuse) he has now been in recovery since Jan 2022,in June 2021 I lost my voice. Its now been diagnosed as a conversion disorder. Its been over a year of having no voice,I don't care about myself,don't take care of myself. Don't get me wrong I take care of everyone else (my dad who is in ill health,my mum who is on the verge of becoming homeless through no fault of her own,my son who's now 14 with his complex health needs a rare neurological condition,autism,adhd and severe learning difficulties I have to cover everything when it comes to his care which of course is my job). Since my voice went I just don't like being in the world,I feel like a burden,I can't even have a full conversation with anyone. I've had numerous counselling through the years. I have been having voice therapy since April 2022 and there's been no progress.  I now have to wait until Jan 2023 for my next appointment. I feel so pointless and yes of course I'm needed but I feel myself,as an individual is pointless.  I also have adenomyosis which puts me in agony probably around 14days a month. I can't go out anywhere to socialise because its exhausting,I'm feeling very lonely,isolated,forgotten whatever you wanna describe it as. 
I can't go to the shops unless I know exactly where things are,because asking for help becomes a complete chore and most people just blankly stare at me. 
I tried to go for a meal with my son and partner earlier of course with it being the festive season everywhere is busy and we essentially sat in silence because again I can't make myself heard. I'm close to tears writing this because its probably the first time I've ever fully written out how I'm feeling. I don't know what I'm expecting from writing this I just needed to get it out. I can't read to my son because he cannot hear me. I can't chat to people in the street for the same reason. I can't ring people or answer the phone.

"Heya, I'm hoping to get some friendly advice.

My mum has always suffered with her mental health but especially recently I've noticed a deterioration. She's either very manic, or extremely sad. Me and my mum are EXTREMELY close and speak/ video call everyday without fail so I can easily pick up on any change she has.

She is saying things which are quite upsetting, worrying and completely out the blue but can't see that anything is wrong and we're all tiptoeing around her and being careful what we say so we don't trigger her. I've just been keeping in touch with her and being an ear so she can voice how she feels with no judgement. 

My mum has been through an awful lot, but is the strongest person in the world. I'm very aware two things can be true at the same time however. She's strong, extremely self aware but also very vulnerable. I'm trying to get her help without her knowing because she's very sensitive that people think she's crazy as she feels the things she's saying makes complete sense and that her ""eyes have finally opened."" I've tried to ring her doctors but they can only assess her if she agrees. 

Has anyone got any advice how I can approach her to get help, or if there are any services that can step in? I'm very worried where things can go if they get worst and just at my wits end with what to do next or how I can help her get back to the best version of herself.

"‚ö†Ô∏èTrigger Warning‚ö†Ô∏è Binge Eating, Numbers, Weight Gain‚õîÔ∏è

Hello I am reaching out for some support. I am struggling with anxiety and depression due to this recent weight gain and it has slowly taken over me. I am currently in a slump because I have gained over 35 pounds in two years. I used to be 135 and so happy. I am somewhere around 175 now..I started gaining some weight because I was traveling frequently. It was only a few pounds but I noticed and I started obsessing. So I tried losing weight yeah I lost some but it was temporary something would come up and I would fall behind. Whether it was a big social event that involved eating ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù food or just waking up late. (I hated waking up late because I would always go to the gym early and when I woke up late I usually had no motivation to go the gym) Any small thing would set me back. Then came the binge eating.. worst thing ever. I figured if I couldn‚Äôt start that day let me start on monday or a specific date. Till that date came I ate and ate and ate. I would eat until I was literally sick. I would feel so guilty and then I would start the restriction. The day would come when I was supposed to start, if I slipped up one tiny thing in my plan and it ruined me. In the process of me hyper fixating on my weight I let myself stray away from my studies. I have an addiction -procrastination-. My grades have slipped because of this. My high standards that I used to follow I have not been able to follow them. And I hate myself for it but I am reaching out now I need help and support. I actually did good for about a month in the summer and lost 7 pounds and I felt great but then I started school again. I didn‚Äôt control myself I would get hungry after school and my binge habits came back. Then the comments about my body from my peers didn‚Äôt help either. I am at the point I just want to give up. I hate eating around people so I end up eating large portions of food at night. I just need some guidance and support. Just a side note, I have contacted nutritionist and I followed plans but I have always seem to fall back and I have basically come to a point where I have given up. This is my last try but I am really hoping to get back on my feet again. I also am not up to trying any supplements/medication. I want to lose weight naturally! Thank you if you read all of this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",Come join my live for Q&A hopefully I can help with some awareness I am a mental heath nurse and currently on section in hospital,Dm
"Trigger warning suicide Ideation. 

For as Long as I can remember I've considered/thought about suicide. It hasn't been a consistent feeling and it has varied in intensity. But the feeling has been there for the majority of my life. I think the only time I didn't have the thoughts/feelings is when I was very, very young. I think it would be safe to say the only reason I haven't tried is because I don't have the courage. (for lack of a better term) I guess that's a blessing. Of course there is a very small part of me that wants to keep living, but I can feel that part of me getting smaller and smaller, but the good news is that I don't think i'll ever have the courage to go through with it. And I know there are people in my life that want me to stick around so that's another thing that kind of keeps me going.  But the point to this long text is this.  How many of us committed suicide a long time ago but our bodies, our consciousness just didn't get the message. I suspect there is a lot of us. In other word's even though we are alive,  we haven't been living for a very long time. Just existing, going through the motions of life but not feeling anything. Just getting through one day after the next. I suppose this is better than actually being dead, because at least this way there is still a little bit of hope, a chance. That maybe one day with a lot of effort and some luck things can be better and we can start really living for possibly the first time in life. 

It's at this point I feel like I should try to offer some hope after what is a pretty dark and depressing post. All I can say is don't give up, hang in there. There are people who need you and love you. You probably have a bigger impact on people's lives around you than you realize. And we might be in pain now, and life might really suck for a big verity of reasons there's always a chance that things can change. If we ended it now we would be missing out on what might have been.  I know this is all Cliche, but it's true.  It's the hope that I hold on to and that keeps me going. I hope that it will keep you going too.",Come join my live for Q&A hopefully I can help with some awareness I am a mental heath nurse and currently on section in hospital,Dm

"Hello everyone. Before starting I want to mention a trigger warning. I tried my best of what I knew how to censor sensitive words and so on but I'm not sure I did well. I'm not somebody who posts something or even opens up to anyone but I'm in the really bad mental situation and I don't have anyone at all to talk to. I had my now ex best friend that our friendship ended because of terrible argument and now looking back after some time I can see that that friendship was only beneficial to her and quite toxic but I stayed because I didn't want to be alone and wanted to have someone to talk to because even though I am medically diagnosed with anxiety disorder and OCD my parents don't take it seriously and even get mad at me when I go silent because my mental health is getting worse. I'll put a couple of messages after this post what my mom wrote to me today. My parents were never emotionally available and when I was bullied or had any problems they just told me to just not pay any attention to those people or that they have worse problems and my problems doesn't count. So I shut down and all they know about me is my created character that I act in front of them because it's easier to do that than to exhaust yourself trying to explain to them my mental illness and how I'm feeling and risk being called a liar or manipulator or being yelled at. 3 years ago I myself found and went to the psychiatrist to get help because I was in a super bad place where I even considered su1c1d3 and was s3lf h4rm1ng. No one knew about it and noone cared I just knew that if I won't do something I won't be on this earth for much longer. Now after 3 years I'm doing much better and I'm on medication and seeing professional even though there's still bad periods where my mental health declines drastically but then after some time I resurface and continue trying to get better. Last year I had a huge downfall because my uncle who was more like my dad emotionally then my actual dad that I'm honestly afraid of to talk to or ask anything because I don't know when or what will set him if and he'll scream at me or I don't put past him anything else. So last year my uncle I mentioned committed su1c1d3 that literally took the ground from under my feet because even though him passing was hurtful enough that reminded me of where I could have been then 2 years ago exactly in his place if I didn't get help. It still hurts till today but at least I can remember him and think about him without those terrible pictures and voices and memories in my head. At the moment I'm not in a terrible place but in a quite bad place mentally and have a few problems like having to take my guinea pig to the vet because she has a weird lump and my parents don't care at all and I'm struggling to convince them to help me to pay for her visit. I love animals more than anything. In my life they're the only thing that truly loves and cares about me.  And just beyond that it's just a period of time when I again got worse and my mental health declined and I need to wait and work it through but it's just I'm completely alone, with noone to talk to, with noone who cares or understands me and even though me being introvert now screams at me what am I doing posting here but it seems like the only chance to get heard by someone because I'm struggling and I don't want to give in into my dark thoughts again. If anyone would be able to read this and hear me and help me that would mean more than I could ever express in my life. üòîüò¢

This image is the text my mom sent me today not wanting to talk so to let my father rest and not disturb him. From my point of view I spent my days in constant fear waiting for them to come back from work as to finish and get done everything so I won't get screamed at but I guess I'm still not doing enough. I usually cannot fall asleep because of my anxiety and stay up late on my phone because then I feel safe, they're sleeping and I won't get screamed at or anything else and I can just have my time either way I cannot sleep and just lay there looking at the ceiling.",You are doing well by recognising ‚Äòthe signs‚Äô before they happen - this is a huge and positive step to learning to live with and manage depression. Be proud that you have made this start for your self.,"Does your country have a disability income for people who are disabled and if so you might check to see if mental health is one that qualifies or if your back pain is enough to qualify. Because if you can get disability income plus some welfare help you can move out of your parents house. They seem to be toxic to you right now. Which I understand, my mom was toxic to me and I spent my senior year of high school in an institution until I graduated, then I moved in with my grandparents in another state to get ready for college. My baby sister followed soon after but moved in with our dad and step family. You might look up a book titled TOXIC PARENTS by Dr. Susan Forward with Craig Buck. It may be helpful to you."

"Hi! I recently joined this group as I have been facing utter depression from past few months! I've always feared of losing people in my life either my family or friends. I was never this guy with such a small circle, but somehow converted into an introvert guy having just 4 to 5 friends. The fact is, i just did almost everything for my friends as I know that what you give is what you recieve. From the past years, I've found it so hard to cope from my problems and get out of the dark phase alone, i needed help from the only friends that were left in my life. I never found any single one of them in my hard times and always blamed myself (still do) that if you are alone in your downtime, you did not give them enough support. I've damn tried everything even forgot myself in the process of giving them all i could offer but still struggling in my downtime on my own.. I feel like i want to scream out loud to them that i need you guys the way you needed me, i need you now please!!! I'm a 24yrs old guy and sometimes i just cry like a baby in shower or in my bed and can't help myself! I feel ashamed of crying as guys normally don't cry but trust me i can't help myself! Writing this all down here just to express as i got nowhere to go or to talk!",Always look after yourself first. If you help someone else make sure they help you. Friendship is a two way street.

I don‚Äôt know where to start‚Ä¶..
Nov 21 I decided I had had enough of my Narcissistic  husband of 18 years‚Ä¶.. stupidly I took him back ( he had started taÔøºliking to another woman I thought nothing of it) then February 22 I was strong enough to tell him I want out I couldn‚Äôt take no more of him and his ways, our kids were seeing the fights, arguments and the way he treated me, he would be all nice to me saying let‚Äôs go to mc D for a hot choc get me in the car away from the house and start screaming at me I would come home emotional and go straight to bed‚Ä¶. 
February he started looking for another house and strangely enough started talking again to the same woman he did in the Nov ( he hadn‚Äôt stopped things now I noticed I now see why he did it like turn his WhatsApp status off become distant and treating me worse) this went on like this till April when he moved out. Since then he‚Äôs turned my mother and brothers against me, my mother knowing he raped me, hearing him when she called me shouting at me to get in my bedroom ( I locked from the day he forced himself on me ) she‚Äôs even met his new woman ( from the Nov) saying how nice she is, when I confronted her about everything her words were ‚Äú what do you expect me to do about it‚Äù she‚Äôs never been supportive or there for me so shouldn‚Äôt have expected anything different my brothers are also the same‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs turned my older kids against me ( not even his kids) and now this weekend 2 of our 3 kids are moving in with him, meaning I‚Äôm losing my kids ( I‚Äôve been there for them since day one no support from him) and now he‚Äôs the best thing because he‚Äôs buying them. I‚Äôm so down at the min an emotional wreck don‚Äôt want to be in this house , I do work but only part time I‚Äôm just trying to find a good support net work for when I‚Äôm feeling low I can chat to someone I do have a very supportive boyfriend but I don‚Äôt any to scare him away üòû",I agree with the lady above you don‚Äôt deserve what he is putting you through see your doctor tell them everything they point you to resources if you need to talk you can call the crisis line I will be praying for you,Don‚Äôt stop talking to your family and kids.

My partner got up and left before the new year cos we were fighting and arguing a lot and it was too much for him more so. So we took a break, we came back and talked things out and he moved back in, but the last couple of weeks more so last week I‚Äôve been really struggling having major breakdowns feeling sick and I did get moody and take things out on him but I was so heightened with everything and I know I shouldn‚Äôt because tbh that‚Äôs what‚Äôs drove him away and I need help I‚Äôve had the doctors with mental health nurse and starting that for myself: I knew something was up all day my mum phoned and told me he‚Äôs packed all his stuff and gone to his aunties I haven‚Äôt heard from him only from the message he text my mum, I‚Äôm so hurt I‚Äôm so angry. I knew something was up by the texts etc and he‚Äôs done this before just went to his aunties and stayed without speaking to me like a man and grow up and tell me the truth instead he abandoned me and we had a lot of moments last week but not mainly because of us but because of me and how much I‚Äôm struggling with my mental health and clearly he can‚Äôt cope with my mental health and all last week he kept saying I‚Äôll never leave you like I did again I‚Äôll always be here through thick and thin etc and he‚Äôs got up and left took all his stuff and left. my mum phoned him to find out what‚Äôs going on and basically alot of it he‚Äôs not telling the truth and threw me under the bus to the point he‚Äôs making it about him and I‚Äôve ruined him (he didn‚Äôt say but implying it). I haven‚Äôt told my parents how much I‚Äôm struggling yet and was going to in my own time and he‚Äôs blabbed and said it to them and I‚Äôm quite annoyed at 

Been thinking of everything and all the stress tbh we have and he has put me through. With the fact he got up and left the first and now he waited for me to leave yesterday and pack up and leave he only just messaged at about 10:15ish where I have been on edge since all day on valentines I‚Äôve realised he‚Äôs been a mind f**k telling me how much he loves me, how much he won‚Äôt abandon me he‚Äôs lied to my parents about things and pretty much threw me under the bus and knowing I‚Äôm struggling and panicking and freaking out when he was away having the time of his life having a birthday meal leaving me having panic attacks, I don‚Äôt think he is the right guy for me knowing that if we got back together I‚Äôm going to be constantly in my head worrying what if my moods or mental health is too much and he leaves again and if we had a future if it got too much when we got a house or children and got up and left 

Please let me know thanks","You have the answers you are seeking, in this post.

I'm really struggling to see the point of life if all I'm going to have is suffering and ruined dreams with no one trying to help me!","I'm under several doctors as is but they don't understand the cause of my symptoms and my test result make no sense to them so they try to spend as little time as possible on my problems. They sometimes lie to get rid of me as they don't want to spend time on a time consuming patient with complex problems.

the neurologist I saw was no help he lied and fudged results and insulted me and I tried to see a different neurologist but couldn't as the only one available was the assistant of the one I was already seeing and he was not gonna take me on an risk offending his boss, the siezure specalist I was seeing who had some success in helping me moved away and I haven't been able to find another seizure specalist. I tried getting referred to pain specalist and am still waiting. I'm on waiting list to have my vision problems investigated again. What's pushed me over the edge is for years they been telling me my blood tests are normal but when I asked about my latest blood results at my GP clinic the receptionist let slip apart from my blood sugar levels and cholesterol all my other blood markers are out of range as is normal for me. I have never been told by any of my doctors that it's normal for my red blood markers to be too low, my white blood markers to be too high, to show markers showing inflammation and markers for liver and kidney function also out of the normal range but this is apparantly normal for me.

She has disappeared with our children and all our valuables. Its a long story but in trying to find my family and doing a lot of research on the matter, I discovered there is just not enough awareness out there. It can be tricky dealing with someone who suffers from mental illness but i also discovered how much it has affected my own mental illness. I always thought I was strong enough to deal with anything but this has shown me how vulnerable we all are when things change so rapidly. You don't have to be born with it. Sometimes life throws you a curve ball that can change everything in an instant, like what happened to me. needless to say, in trying to find my family and get my wife the help she needs, I discovered so much and now I have become an advocate for mental illness. I have created a website( still under construction) for people who are suffering in some shape form or fashion, or know someone who is. it also explains my story but I also have advice articles that may be able to help those in need and to help increase awareness. A lot of these things are things that have helped me on my journey so I want to spread the knowledge. I am not a doctor or professional in that field but I have learned a lot. I believe what I am experiencing is a blessing in disguise from God to do my part to help others or to at least share what I have learned. I have learned a lot about myself being alone and my home being so quiet. There is such a lack of understanding, empathy, and care when it comes to mental health. I know this because I was one of those who just didn't understand so I made a lot of mistakes when it came down to understanding exactly what my wife needed from me and even though she did not communicate with me on the things she needed me to understand, I should've done the research so I could know what to do. Maybe too little too late now. So I want to help others before it's too late for them.",Good afternoon everyone and welcome

"I left an abusive relationship. 
My mom begged me before she died to leave and it actually caused fights between us. 

After she passed away, the mental and emotional abuse got worse.. 

Until a couple months ago when he hit me. I started thinking about leaving. So I finally did. I'm set to go to a shelter on Monday and currently was able to get the motel for a night before he drained the accounts.

"I‚Äôm so sorry this is going to be a long post, I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2012 but I‚Äôve been gradually getting worse in how I‚Äôm feeling and I feel like I have more then just anxiety and depression, I have written down everything I feel, I know none of you are doctors but I was just wondering what your thoughts are? do you think all this is just anxiety and depression or could it be something else along side that, I‚Äôm just sick of feeling the way I‚Äôm feeling, I just want to feel normal üò≠ thanks x 

I feel over whelmed when there‚Äôs so much going on In a room for example kids playing, tv on, tap running, someone‚Äôs phone also playing loud etc 

Social anxiety, I don‚Äôt like being around people, small talk or being out in public it makes me so tired 

I believe everyone judges me on how I look and instantly doesn‚Äôt like me 

I have to do certain things other wise I fear something bad will happen to my children for example I have to make sure all the washing is the right way and not inside out when it goes in the machine, I have to fill my water glass up a certain way 

If I‚Äôm going anywhere I plan and re plan my journey so I know I will never be late as being late makes me anxious 

I don‚Äôt like change, I have to keep to routine other wise I feel like everything is falling apart and I get really over whelmed 

My mood can go from 0-100 in the matter of seconds, I snap really easily 

I worry constantly, I literally worry about worrying 

I struggle sleeping at night but then struggle staying awake in the day, I‚Äôm always so tired 

I have difficulty concentrating the room has to be silent and only me in to be able to watch tv other wise I‚Äôm easily distracted 

If I do end up watching something I‚Äôm up and down because I remember I need to do certain task and I can‚Äôt relax until it‚Äôs done 

I make little tasks/chores seem like massive tasks in my head then I get really over Whelmed and stressed and start hand fidgeting or rubbing my eyes and then get angry 

I don‚Äôt like people in my home like workmen or if I know the gardeners due my anxiety is up and I can‚Äôt relax until I know that person has gone 

I make list after list for bills or planning a holiday, if I don‚Äôt make lists i dont feel organised or know what I‚Äôm doing 

I don‚Äôt make friends or have any friends I like being on my own, in my own home, I don‚Äôt really go out as I hate being out in public 

I also hate making eye contact, making eye contact makes me feel really uncomfortable 

I can‚Äôt go to bed if I know there‚Äôs stuff that needs doing, so all pots need to be done etc because I can‚Äôt wake up to mess 

If I make plans and then the plans have to change suddenly, I struggle to adjust",Are you getting treatment for anxiety and depression? Seems like your giving yourself too much work to do. How are your finances? Do you have o.c.d.?,Good luck with everything. Keep in touch

"I'm new here and I am really struggling. I lost my father about 3 months ago. My mother is now blaming me for her loneliness.  She thinks I don't care about her. I live about 800 miles away. I have asked her several times if she wanted me to come back home to stay and she always says no. Now she says that I left her. She is mean and hateful to me when I call to check on her which is every day. I am her only child and a huge disappointment to her. I am in my 50's and am just trying to live my life the best that I can. I have always been respectful of my parents and tried to be the perfect daughter. I am really feeling lost and depressed and don't know what to do. At this point, moving back would just make me her live in punching bag but if I don't move back I am a bad and in her words crazy person. I'm wrong no matter how hard I try.....","I had a similar time with my dad. For 15 yrs after my mum died he was looked after by myself and my sisters. We cooked and had him to our houses even those he was more often than not derogatory and miserable.  We put it down to grief but after 15 yrs he still wasn't much better.  Everything we did was wrong. He blamed us for his loneliness and constantly let us know how badly we let him down playing one sister against another.  2 yrs ago I started suffering with more severe depression partly down to him and his needs. I had tried to be a good daughter and had been made to feel useless but it suddenly dawned on me. Whatever I do, he will never be happy or grateful for, his attitude was he can be Whatever he wants and we owe him for being born and that he kept us alive whilst dependent.  I realised that if I was going to get grief for being as good as I could be to please him, it would be no different if I didn't do those things. They like power to hold you with emotional blackmail.  Give yourself a pat on the back for trying as long as you have but step back. She is selfish and needs to realise you are worth so much more. I went no contact a couple of years ago and it's the best thing I ever did. You are far away enough to put boundaries in place.  If I were you I would limit the phone calls to minimal and tell her it will stay that way until she changes and stick to it. If she gets worse then no phone calls at all. People like that are never happy until they make everyone as miserable as they are. Respect is something everyone is entitled to including you. Remember to put yourself first for a change. (Sorry long post but I can see where you are heading and she doesn't deserve it from what you have said.) When she treats you like a human being then you can revise your contact. Don't feel guilty for not accepting abuse. X good luck",Has your mother seen a doctor recently? It sounds like she might be suffering from dementia. I'm no doctor but have experienced this with my grandmother.

"Hello group. I have a delicate situation right now. I have a very sweet young man for a friend who has schizophrenia and he is homeless.  He has pushed me away. He has been acting more and more afraid, talking of super powers, things that are hard to understand and just generally not making much sense, This is totally out of charector for him. He has gone off of his medication, which is probably why he is having a psychotic breakdown., and has went missing after saying he'd have to distance himself from his loved ones. This is the first person I've ever really gotten to know really well that has this mental illness. I worry for his safety and wellbeing. I know that he's not going to be located very easily, at least for now. Can someone please help me to understand what he is going through? How could I help him? What can I expect, if anything, going forward?","There‚Äôs nothing you can really do except be kind to yourself. 

I‚Äôve been there. My mother was bi polar. When she went into a manic episode, there was no force under the sun that could help her. 

I‚Äôm sorry. This is just a truth of the illness. I always stuck around and it battered me my entire life, the impotence of a son wanting to help but unable to do anything except watch the descent into madness. 

The illness is altering his perception of reality. His truth. The reality is so foreign to you that you cannot possible grasp it to even emphasize. As I say in my podcast about depression, it‚Äôs like if I told you the sky was an orange pastel, roses smelled like horses, filet mignon tasted like halibut and a baby‚Äôs cry sounded like Mozart. If this was my reality, how how could you understand? 

He needs to be on his meds and get professional treatment, probably hospitalization to get the meds stabilized. 

I‚Äôm sorry.","Have him sectioned as soon as possible.
From someone with schizophrenia. It's for his own saftey, irrespective of what or how he feels about you after. Have him medically looked at."

Also feeling remorseful about the people that I *have* hurt in the past, sometimes even heartbroken. However, I still intend to mention that concern to my therapist.

However, more importantly, I discovered that my ego actually has been rampaging out if control for quite a number of years. Which may very likely be the reason why I've inadvertently hurt those people in the past, but may also be the underlying reason for many of the things I've wanted in life, that I now realize may actually be harmful to either myself or others.

Since that discovery, I've been doing some reflection and meditation, trying to ""tame and retrain"" my ego. Not only getting it under control, but also trying to harness it the way it should be. The way a healthy and properly developed ego should be.

But I think that in the attempt, I've lost my identity, or maybe just need to take some time, and the guidance of therapy, to discover who I am now.

Update: I know what happened now. I purged all the bad shit, but didn't think to replace it with good shit, so I was basically empty. An easy fix for a ""shadow worker"" üòÜ",As long as you are not hurting people surely you can be yourself.

I lost my dog a Year and half ago and was devastated so I completely understand your pain. I Couldn‚Äôt face getting another dog straight away and my daughter wanted a cat. So we got 2. 
I wouldn‚Äôt risk myself homeless for a pet, could you look into moving somewhere that allows animals before you get another 1? Or as someone else said, if it‚Äôs registered as a support animal the landlord has to allow it.

So I tell my dad about this (I'm still 18 by the way, and right now I'm still in college). But then, after I told my dad about this. my dad reaction was, you need pray and talk to God. It's so hard and tired, lived with people who doesn't have open minded about mental health. 

Now I have to take medicine for my anxiety and depression. 

My dad approves me to go to psychiatrist, but he keeps saying you need to pray more. But I already done all of that :)). Then when I ask him truly, he said honestly I don't like you to go to psychiatrist and take meds, you just need put your faith in God, and everything will goes away, yeah I know all of that.

"Hi, everyone! I just want to share something, and I hope y'all can help me with this.
 
Recently, I've been thinking about how to completely distance myself from certain people I became ""close friends"" with in college after finding out that they're ""toxic"". 

It's been extremely difficult for me to adjust because we're in the same year, studied the same program, and went to the same university in college. Worse, we'll run into each other on campus at any time. I'm worried that if I get rid of them, they'll be upset with me.

This leads me to the point that I am having panic attacks every night because of overthinking, and it affects my mental health so badly.

So here's my question: Is it the best decision for my mental health to distance myself from them? What are some things I should do to make it less obvious?","You are doing the right thing. It's important to recognise that they weren't real friends at all. Think back to all the times that they have let you down. And think of WHY you are choosing to distance yourself in the first place. You deserve better. And to tell you the truth, it hurts at first. It hurts that you don't have friends to back you up in life. But I promise it gets better after time. You just ha e to go through the five stages of grief, denial, anger, Bargaining, Sadness and finally, Acceptance. Validate yourself and start enjoying spending your time alone, do activities and work on your social persona. After time, as you meet better people, you feel happy that you left those friends behind.","Hello there! It sounds like you're going through a challenging situation, and it's brave of you to seek help.

Prioritizing your mental health is essential. If you find these relationships to be toxic and detrimental to your well-being, it might be a valid choice to create some distance, but rather than abruptly cutting ties, gradually reduce the time spent together. This can make the process less obvious and give you the space you need."

"My doctor prescribed Concerta for me, and I do not have ADHD. I have depression.. Has anyone ever heard of ADHD medications that treat diseases other than ADHD.. Can they really help me get rid of anhedonia and increase motivation and motivation? Those who have tried Concerta, is the drug really addictive because it is frequently cut off in the country? who live in it","Undiagnosed ADHD or ADD in adults often presents as anxiety and depression etc. This is a consequence of a lifetime spent trying to fit in and get on with life whilst being judged to be not good enough, no matter how hard we try, and being viewed as deliberately not cooperating or trying hard enough despite giving it 110%! A common feature is anhedonia. I've experienced periods of anxiety and depression since my childhood, including issues with food and body image. I became a mental health nurse, and only then did I realise that I probably had grown up with ADHD. I got my diagnosis at 48, and began Concerta. Since then, I've noticed that my depression and anxiety are much better, or rather I find challenging times much easier to manage, I get cross and frustrated with myself far less, and my other heath problems (chronic pain and fatigue due to autoimmune issues) are much improved. It could be that your doctor believes that you could have ADHD and your mental health issues are a symptom rather than a problem in their own right? On a more technical level, mental ill health has a complicated neurochemical side, people with ADHD have issues with their Dopamine levels in particular. Other neurotransmitters such as Seratonin are often also out of whack too. So, your Dr may be prescribing Concerta as a way of altering your neurotransmitter production & absorption. Please don't worry about becoming 'addicted', it's really not that bad.",Hey there I‚Äôm just checking in to see if you‚Äôre feeling any better?

"Please forgive me for my rambling post, I'm hoping that maybe I might feel better for it. For years I've been hiding behind a false persona. Pretending to be happy when I'm not and then when I am happy by actively thinking of things depressing.
For 12 years now I've had a well and truly dodgy heart. Multiple and I mean multiple 13+ heart attacks, arrythmia problems with multiple operations, a shredded femeral artery  and a triple bypass during lockdown.
The bypass helped fix things on the plumbing side but ruined the results of all my operations for arrythmia problems.
I now have one access point in case of an emergency angio.
Last April I had a nstemi which is a heart attack that doesn't show on an ECG.
My angio was clear but extremely painful.
All this aggro has resulted in depression with a bit of PTSD thrown in.
Last July it got too much and I took an overdose.
Things were getting a bit better after discharge but I find it impossible to tell the people I love and trust the most my real feelings.
Instead I will just jump in the car and disappear for a few hours and even a couple of days, just sleeping in the car not eating or drinking.
Today I took the mother in law to an appointment in Bedford.
When I left her it took me 6 hours to do a 3 mile journey.
I just couldn't handle going back home.
Something inside just switches off.
It's got to the stage again where I'm starting to think that everyone would be better of without me.
I will probably seek help again in the morning but it's so difficult getting the help.
I find it difficult to speak to the professionals and am always on the guard and hiding my feelings.
I do sometimes wish that I just drop off to sleep at night and never wake up.
Anyway I've put this post up because I'm at my wits end and I know that some others among you all may relate to this.

"I have been feeling very angry lately. Then I get very depressed because I'm angry. Then I feel even worse. 
I do not feel well mentally and physically. I'm emotionally exhausted üò© 
There's nothing that makes me feel better. I like taking walks but not where I live because I'm at risk of being mugged, harassed or killed. So when I have to walk my dog I'm in edge. Who can live like this? I do not have the option to move. I'm disabled, not working, and I'm dealing with chronic illnesses and mental health illnesses. üò™ I'm so exhausted üò© I live with anxiety and this overwhelming üò´ feeling in my chest. I'm tired of people telling to just do this or that. It does not work for me. I have no spouse to help me. My children do not help me. I have no friends. I have no family other than my children. Both my parents are deceased. I have no siblings. I'm not seeking attention,  I'm crying üò≠ üò¢ ü§ß I just do not know what to do anymore. I live each day waiting to just go to sleep but even that's a problem because I suffer with severe insomnia. I'm like what I'm the world üåé üòè I still do not feel better. This is the only place I can vent. I absolutely have no other human being that I can turn to. I only have my dog, but he's old and blind and needs a lot of care. We live in our bed. What a life. Well this day every end?","I can relate to so much of what you've described, and I want you to know that you're not alone in these feelings. It's incredibly tough to deal with chronic illnesses, mental health struggles, and feeling isolated all at once.

Just remember that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and exhausted - this is a difficult journey, and it's okay to lean on people who understand. Even if only through this platform, we are here for you, and we genuinely care about supporting each other through these challenging times. Please know that your feelings are valid, and I hope that sharing your thoughts here provides some comfort. üíú",Hi .

A few months ago, we visited a psychiatrist, and she thinks my daughter has a mood disorder or epilepsy but not schizophrenia. If I understand correctly, a mood disorder is a combination of many mental illnesses. She also shows no signs of bipolar disorder. 

My 15-year-old daughter has been hallucinating since a very young age, around 5 years old, experiencing command hallucinations and visual hallucinations. This is the only symptom she has. She is on medication for epilepsy because it helps with mood disorders as well. The voice is about 60% gone.

On the 24th of December we were at the cinema. The previews played for a few seconds when my daughter couldn't handle the darkness and loud noises. We immediately left. On the way home, the voice appeared.

the voice reappeared, saying, ""hello (and my daughter's name)."" My daughter told it to go away, and then it started saying nonsensical words. It went away after a while. 

She will be fine and next moment the ""voice"" appears..üò¢üò≠
My heart breaks for my child!

Her father has epilepsy. She struggles with anxiety from a very young age and recently depression. We also have biopolar in the family. But no one hallucinates

Do you think these are signs of schizophrenia or epilepsy?",There are a lot of mental illnesses that cause hallucinations even severe depression can cause them.,"Hi I'm sorry about your daughter,it all sounds very complex..with all that's going on with your daughter it's must be very depressing for her to have multiple things going on. I'm no expert but if it continues, depression will probably be setting in and and this can cause voices and other hallsinations to happen! Just a question..can you see visual sighns that your daughter is hearing voices like sudden head  movements before she tells the voices to ""go away"" it could be a small dose of antidepressants and antipsycotics just to keep a lid on it all! I'm not a great belivor in meds but they helped me. Ask the doctor or pop to a&e if it continues..good luck"

"Hi all,

I joined this group to find some new and advice per say. As of recently and really this has been going on for years, but I haven‚Äôt felt a drive. From sleeping a lot to minimal motivation it is really killing me. I‚Äôve always felt embarrassed and upset at myself due to the way that I feel and how I‚Äôve been operating. Losing my dad to suicide at 15 years old surely didn‚Äôt help (22 years of age now), but quite honestly I don‚Äôt think about it much anymore. Moved away from my hometown a year ago to another state the loneliness and depression has surely kicked back in. Going to college and trying to meet new people is hard for me. Being an introverted nerd, artist, and art collector I am I have found it extremely hard. Have always felt like a popular loner and quite frankly left out of events and such. Everytime I meet someone at college and get their phone number it always feels as if I pry a conversation with someone. My apologies for the longer post.

My health issues are that I had ADHD when I was young which i might still have and mild Epilepsy since I was 10 and Anxiety with depression since my mum passed away 12 years ago.  Also through social services cognitive assessment I have streaks of Autism and also it takes a long time for my brain to process things and a reading age of 13 which I agree because I can only read a couple of paragraphs then stop before carrying on.

So is there anyone that can help please.",I have a disability and I had two children that both got taken away but from birth not from an older age. The authorities took them both from me and from my partner saying all kinds of things. From saying that we would be neglectful to even blaming the house. Saying that it would not be safe for a child. They never gave us a chance to parent at home only in a contact centre or a parent and child unit. Which did not seem to work either. Neither one of us got the child back and even family did not get the child. This happened twice but even though the second time was not completely the same as the first it still ended in the same result. I had to carry two children for nine whole months and then for people to act like you were having the children for them and we got no compensation from them either. I also had two abortions and a miscarriage to add to the issue. The problem was is that I am on the autistic spectrum and my partner was alcohol dependent. They had their worries and they had their concerns about us. They even said that my score was not good enough and that my partner was not supportive enough. So how would that of worked? So it was just me and him in the end just having a relationship with each other and having children to give away.,"Hi, there are clearly some things you have raised that are birth issues, so my question is - I'm here, what would you like help with?"

"Afternoon Everyone üëãüèª

I honestly don‚Äôt know where to start, Im stuck - I have had a bad feeling inside all afternoon, I just don‚Äôt feel like I have meaning - I don‚Äôt mean that in a bad way, I mean like the person standing in the middle of a busy shopping mall as everyone else walks past not noticing you. 

I had an argument with a stranger today disrespecting my property and since ive felt this Ive felt the weirdness.

Sorry if Im rambling, I have ADHD GAD BPD & Bi Polar type 2.",Hun it's best to ramble than keep it all in I've got anxiety so going into a busy shopping place is like going to the dentist for me some people just don't care that your struggling or just don't see it because some of the things we have are hidden hope things got better this afternoon x,hii..  seems like u feel unheard and unseen and want people in your life to pause and take notice of u?  have u taken help for your mental  health?
"So.. I don't really know where to start with this. 

I've been with my husband for 12 years, married for 4 and we have a 1 and a half year old little boy. 
We've suffered 3 miscarriages and 1 23 week old loss of our little boy due to me getting pre-eclampsia, unfortunately our first little boy lived for 4 days before he died. 

Since our 2nd little boy was born, and especially since he got a bit more aware of the world, my husband hasn't really ever bonded with him. He doesn't know how to play with him, doesn't know his routine, what he eats for dinner, even though I update him every day on how he's been when he's with me. I work part time so I can spend more time with my little boy and this works for us. 

Anyway.. fast forward to the last few month, my little boy is going through an absolutely terrible time with sleep, he's up all through the night, some nights I take him downstairs at 3 in the morning until around 7am when he falls back to sleep, and we have tried EVERYTHING to try and get him to sleep better and nothing works. 

My husband is absolutely terrible. He shouts, he throws stuff in anger, he has been known to headbutt doors, punch and break things around the house. He's never hurt me or our son ever and if he ever did, well.. I'd be gone in a shot. 

But.. lastnight, our little boy was up and down from 12-3 and my husband was up with him because he's not working and I was today so I needed sleep. My little boy woke up at 3.30am and it was me who went downstairs with him even though I was meant to be in work at 8am. My little boy was still awake when I left for work so you can imagine how shattered I am today. 
When my husband is working, he goes mad if I don't take my son downstairs because 'he was to work and I'm at home in the day time'

Anyway, when I got my pants on to go downstairs, my husband turned to me and said I'd be buggered for work to which I replied, well.. you're not taking him downstairs so I can sleep seeing as I've got work, so it's down to me.. his reply 'well you didn't even ask' and then persisted to call me a d***head as I went downstairs.. then, when he came waltzing downstairs at 6.15am this morning, my son took a book to him and my son got 'if you think I'm reading that, you've another thing coming'

This isn't normal behaviour is it? 
He speaks to me like absolute crap most of the time. What do I do?",We can speak together if you want. You can send me a pm üôÇ,"His emotionally and verbally abusing you. It could be why your little boy is so, unsettled. Your experiencing domestic abuse. I don't think you need me to tell you it's time to get out of this relationship. Your post tells me that you know this deep down already. Don't need me or anybody else to validate that. Your capable you do everything on your own anyway."

"I'm hoping someone could name this feeling I get. I call it ""Big Brother"" (a reference to the tv show big brother).

Focus on the person who should always be no1 in your life - YOU!

Do you understand that everything in your life starts and ends with you? 
You ARE your most important person of interest, one of a kind, and a God's miracle.

Right now you are not in sync with that, that is why the feeling of anxiety and depression is all over you.

You deserve all the respect and love that you are seeking and you can get it. 
But, the trick is that first it has to come from you towards yourself. 

Once you accomplish that, good men will be flying in your life and will treat you right because you will treat yourself that way and that is what you will project. 

I promise you that!

"TRIGGER WARNING - Dr*g misuse & cheating. 

I just need a rant aswell as a little advice. I appreciate it‚Äôs a long post but I really really need to get it off my chest as it‚Äôs affecting my mental health   üíî 

So I‚Äôve been with my partner for 7 years now. We are in a same s‚Ç¨x relationship. I have been physically cheated on with at least 6 different women and have caught her talking to probably 5 other women throughout these 7 years. I‚Äôve took her back every single time because I love her and have always seen the best in her. This isn‚Äôt a trauma bond, I have been through therapy and established that this isn‚Äôt why I haven‚Äôt left. It‚Äôs been my choice. My partner also was a recovering addict and throughout the years she‚Äôs had many relapses and most of them I‚Äôve caught her doing it or just know from how she‚Äôs acting. So this weekend we had an event to attend and we‚Äôve been great at the minute. Everything running smooth (our kids getting on) and our relationship is stable. Last time we went to a similar event she got dr*gged up and took p!lls. She completely embarrassed me and she promised me for this event she wouldn‚Äôt touch anything. We‚Äôre sat at this table and I notice she keeps licking her lips, won‚Äôt stay still and just chatting absolute crap. I look in her eyes and instantly think she‚Äôs took dr*gs. I choose to ignore it because other people are around and don‚Äôt want to cause a scene. Next thing she asks if I want a drink. I say yes she gets up to get one. 20 minutes later I‚Äôm sat there like a spoon on my own like where tf is she? So I go looking for her and she‚Äôs at a bar chatting crap with random people with a drink for herself! I kinda lost it and was like are you taking the effing p*ss!! I‚Äôve been sat on my own and your over here with a drink for yourself forgetting I‚Äôm sat over there waiting for a drink you offered me?? I walk back to the table with her after she gets me a drink and then she goes I need the toilet. I was like right ok. Off she goes. HALF AN HOUR passes and I‚Äôm about to loose my sh!t. I walk to the toilets and I walk round the corner and she‚Äôs walking out the disabled toilets with another woman she called ‚Äúher friend she hasn‚Äôt seen in years‚Äù. I DONT CARE!? Your a grown a$$ woman why you coming out the toilet together?? I instantly lost my sh*t and was like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going‚Äù. I walk ahead and turn around and she didn‚Äôt even follow me she walked to the bar with this woman she just walked out the toilets with to get a drink! I ended up shouting at her and didn‚Äôt care who heard because I felt like she was taking the mick out of me. I wasn‚Äôt embarrassed this time round but I was hurt. She lied about taking dr*gs and even when I approached her the night after she still lied to my face about it. She just has an excuse to justify everything. I feel pretty numb towards her right now. I always think I know her turns out I don‚Äôt know who she is. I look at her ever since this event and I‚Äôm like who even are you? I‚Äôm looking at a person that thinks she can do what the hell she wants to me and get away with it. She don‚Äôt care how anything makes anyone feel she does what she wants. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. We‚Äôve been together a long while and there are kids involved. I don‚Äôt want to be the one to break up the family but I really don‚Äôt trust her anymore. Not with dr*gs not with woman, nothing. I‚Äôve been fine recently regarding anxiety lately and just got over the last time she cheated on me and now I‚Äôm feeling sick and anxious and over thinking again. Please can people give me some advice. Am I over reacting about the weekend? Or was she taking the absolute p!ss out of me! I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ especially so close to Christmas üòî please any advice welcome or at least some validation.",Drink and drugs and other people obviously come first then,"honestly sometimes it's best to leave and break up the family so they either realize what they've lost and straighten up or they continue drugs/alcohol. They'll make their choice very clear to you if you just stick to it. If you stay you'll just get worse mentally, I did. You'll drive yourself crazy cause the overthinking won't stop and it'll get worse, even have you questioning yourself. My thoughts are with you because this is pain like no other. You will get through this love."

Does everyone on mirtazepine put on weight? It‚Äôs making me so hungry and I‚Äôm finding it hard to control my appetite.

Any experience of this?,"I've heard this is quite common with some anti-depressants, hope someone else can advise you with personal experience of taking them.

"Hi there. I'm not sure if I'm wording this correctly but when people need support with addiction etc, there are services in place for that person to check into and access the support they need. When someone is having a mental health crisis, is there such a place you can check into and just take a break from everything, reset and heal? I've seen retreats on Google to help with mental health problems, but you have to pay for them. I'm a single Mum of 6 and don't have that kind of money, is there somewhere free or very low cost?

Any advice please. I am plagued every day by constant intrusive loud thoughts and also tension. It's really really painful physically and its making me really grouchy. I'm always taking random pills to make it go away. I feel I have no friends. I'm 34 with no job. I moved back to my flat from mum and dad's and I have found out that the neighbours are drug dealing. They keep harassing me all the time. It is the lady downstairs. She basically won't leave me alone because she knows I know and I feel I can't live there knowing she is there alone with me downstairs in the flat. Also there is a black audi that is parked outside watching. I feel I can't be myself. I keep getting face ache and tension aches. I feel I have lost my happy self now. I'm just stuck in my old room at my folks.,If you want to talk please pm me,How are you doing?
Could really do with a chat feeling very low,Everything okay?,How are you getting on? What are you doing today? Has something happened to make you feel sad? Ask for support from professionals or anyone close to you. Sometimes family and friends don't understand. Do you have a voluntary counselling service in your area? Keep in touch. Good luck
So how is everyone feeling today?  Its better to let it out!,Sad,How can we turn a corner in this when there are still people being ignorant about the 2 meter rule and staying home. The more they listen the quicker  we can get some normality back in this country.

"Hi everyone, I've looked up this group for some advice. My neighbour is a a single mom who struggles really bad with her mental health. The reason for this post is because she has a meeting with dwp next week and they have told her she can't have luxury things like Netflix also days out and so much more. They told her she has to cancel things like her her gym membership that was advised from doctor to go to gym. Surely this isn't right. Hoping someone can advise. TIA üòä",So tell her to go to citizens advice because they can't tell her not to go to the gym if its helps her and also tell her to go to the doctors and get a note to say going to the gym helps her mental health.,How does the dwp what she spends her money on? You claim for your disability not for what you need extra money. Perhaps these things help her with her mental health. Has she seen a psychiatrist to help with her claim? Does she have children?

"While anxiety is something we all experience in the face of stress, whether we are taking exams or going to a social event, when anxiety prevents you from living your life and looking after yourself then you most likely have an anxiety disorder. You may experience symptoms like stomach aches and IBS, headaches and panic attacks, all indicators of an anxiety disorder.

"So my mental health is going down hill again and I am trying so hard to get it under control.. in May 2020 I took a overdose and ended up on life support because I died twice... it all started in April 2020 when people where I live started causing trouble with me I told my housing association and they said they can't do anything about it and told me to write it down so I did that every day and every night they was out stalking me plotting and a lot more so I rang the police and that made it worse on me I rang the housing and still no help from them.... Anyway then I heard a housing staff member talking about me and laughing behind my back about it all she was helping them some lad wanted to climb up to my window and she the staff member said you will fall laughing he said I will give you ¬£80 for the window.. so I told the police. I have emails I've sent to my local councillor, my local MP, I even got Resolver on the case to and no end of emails and phone calls to the housing association. And when I took my overdose in May 2020 I was put back into the same situation and once again no help from them at all. So the other day I got a letter saying that they are taking me to court for my rent arrears also I pay service charges to so I sent them an email stating that I would pay my rent but I'm not paying for the service because I don't get any so I added up the amount of service charges and I sent them an email with the new rent arrears I owe. And told them that's all ya getting off me and told them about the situation where I have been told by a tenant that the housing staff member was telling people about my business she been doing it from day 1 so I put that in the email and wow I got a message saying that its at stage 1 formal investigation. I sent a email regarding that and I told them this should of been sorted out in 2020 but you left me to kill myself you left them to harasses me and my complaints never even got dealt with so your 3 years to late... now this housing woman wants a meeting with me to discuss the issues I've been having still 3 years to late. I have all my complaints since day 1 and I have even found the book I was told to write wow I can't believe what I wrote it made me cry reading it that's how bad it was... so my question is do I have a meeting with her and tell her about the staff member situation and my mental health.. or do I just take it further and sue the housing association to get compensation for everything they have caused me.. oh not to mention the cctv camera they have put up on my boundary wall and guess what it sees my whole back garden and my back door and another cctv camera at the front that faces my front door and I can see it from my landing window and kitchen window to I've got pictures of that so they can't lie like they do some of my emails has been lost to but I have every email from day 1.. so what should I do about it do I have a meeting with them and record them without them knowing or sue the housing.. all I want is a place I can feel safe and get my mental health under control without feeling like a victim in my home... But also I have been told I should meet up tell them everything and see what they say. Then tell them I'm not happy with your response so I'm taking you to court for composition as I know my rights.. or don't take the housing association to court and tell them what I want for the pain and suffering that you have caused me from 2020 and say this is what I want... I want to move to where I want and what property I want.. also I know they have new properties for rent soon to.. so is a new property worth the price for what I've been thought ü§î or drag them to court and take my story to the papers which they already have been by another tenant of their's couple of years ago ü§î 
So following my situation with this do I give them the meeting and tell them what I want the outcome to be or not meet and take it to court and sue them ü§î could someone please help me with this please.. thank you for reading and I hope that someone can help me with this please üôè","Hey man that was intense, thanks so much for sharing, I don‚Äôt want to give bad advice because you‚Äôve already been through so much, but your main focus should be you, your mental health, so taking on a housing association isn‚Äôt something that would likely help.
With that in mind I would first seek free legal advice, in the UK we have citizens advice bureau, I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre from the UK but if not, perhaps your country provide a similar service?
If not contact a legal representative, and have them take over your correspondence with the housing association.
They will have the best advice for that situation.
If your doctor is aware of your situation, they can contact them too and build a strong case for you.

Your mental health is more important than anything else.
Your focus needs to be on you, let others fight some battles for you because you don‚Äôt have to fight them all yourself",I agree as above don't take it all on yourself too much stress too intense. Get someone to do this for you and have someone at the meeting if u do go ahead.  Also maybe letter from Dr's re your mental health deterioration living there etc.
I went out this morning to met new people but I will not be going to tell them about my illness as u don't know who to trust,Yes don't tell your personal story to strangers.

,This is me ,I agree with you 100%
Mental health day doesn‚Äôt exist. To me every day is mental health day,Amen to that.,"I agree with you! 

I think that mental health is the most important thing in life because without your mental health, the rest of life can feel impossible and hopeless. 

Mental health is a priority every day, and we should always make sure that we take good care of our mind, body and spirit ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"How do we develop confidence and build relationships? Any tips?

I'm nearly 40, been in UK  for over 15 years, I'm shy,  kind of introvert.

English is not my first language however I speak good English and generally have no issues, I am educated to master degree.

I work in a senior management role in major company.

I have generally no issues in formal meetings or one to one informal chats.

I feel often left out, not able to join others when there are group conversations. I really try to mix but it just does not work. I try but I can't mix, I don't have accent, fluency, words to talk like native British.

Almost everyone is born in UK in my company, they talk about all sort of things, make jokes but I just can't do this, I am not confident to have jokes with others and scared to get them wrong. English is their 1st language as they born here so they can not understand what I'm going through.

I end up sitting on my desk while everyone else is talking to each other. I seriously get depressed, not able to crack jokes and informal chats.

All my conversations are mostly serious, to the point and work related so people don't get close to me as such.

When others are having group chats, I feel like it will embarrass me with my broken English. They keep joking with each other which I mostly understand but can't make such jokes.

There is no one at level I'm in career who speaks just dictionary English and not born here in UK.

I have lot of potential and can develop in my career but this feeling of being isolated, lack of confidence is major obstacle. I often leave office depressed and someone left out.

Thank you for your understanding.","First of all, your written English is amazing, far superior to my French or Arabic! And I'm sure your spoken English is the same standard.

I think there's a need first of all to accept that you are not going to be able to interact with your British colleagues in the way you want to. And that's ok. You are enough as you are. 

Also realise that you don't need to be funny to be accepted. Being kind and principled counts for far more.

"Can we talk about Mental Health Abuse? I worked with Melissa Farrell, at Spectrum Health and Human Services, until 2/17/2023. During that time, she falsified my chart, attempted treatment on me that she not trained for. During treatment, she left for over 4 months. She is verbally & emotionally abusive. She was manipulative & controlling & would be upset when I didn't do as she says. When I try to express myself, she would stop me from voicing my thoughts, to a point where she omits what I said & write her version of sessions. I am retraumatize & find myself questioning my own self-worth if a professional person in the mental health field would be so intentionally hurtful, what does that say about my worth as person & or even human being. I am finding it hard to move forward & struggling to go about my normal day caring for myself & family. Melissa‚Äôs actions were intentional reckless & never considered how her actions would affect me. I didn't work with a professional, but rather a self-serving person looking out only for herself & how our time working together would be beneficial to her. I was treated by Farrell with zero respect, she lacks integrity, decency and honesty! Recently I was called in by the CEO, Cindy Voelker who threatened me. She began by telling me how Melissa was close longtime friend. She repeated several times that she doesn‚Äôt believe her friend would do such a thing, but if she did it was not intentional. She then told me that if I continue with this complaint, she would make things difficult for me moving forward. CEO Cindy Voelker specifically told me that if I continue this complaint that she would see to it that I would be painted as a liar, mentally unstable, delusional, making this whole thing up or it simply being a she said, she said situation and I had no proof, which I actually do.","The whole system is broken, I actually believe that freemasons have infiltrated most organisations, sounds paranoid but I have had some bad 3xperiences myself with doctors and other so called professionals.. there are some good ones out there though, you just have find them, otherwise look for your own solutions, I know that's hard and depending on situations sometimes impossible but breathwork, yoga and dance have helped me, art, maybe looking at taking a different route through counselling maybe..

Their smiles and laughter light up my day,
And in their love, I find my way,
Through the toughest times and darkest nights,
Their love and support are my guiding lights.

I may feel unloved and unworthy at times,
But their love and presence are like chimes,
That ring out, reminding me to stay,
And fight through the pain, day by day.

Their love is the anchor that keeps me grounded,
Their hugs and kisses, the warmth that surrounds me,
And in their love, I find the strength to carry on,
To face the world with a brave face, and a song.

So when I feel lost and alone,
And wish that I could go away, unknown,
I think of my children and family who need me to stay,
And in their love, I find the courage to face another day.",Beautiful,I Care

How does someone discover their passion?,Omar Makhlouf What did you love doing as a kid? What could you find joy in doing all day if money wasn‚Äôt an option? What do your friends and family call you for most? Ask the three closest people to you what you are great at doing? When you get those answers start exploring in what areas can you tap into those abilities the most. Then see what feels the most right to you. Whatever continues to flow continue to flow with it and see where it takes you. I hope this helps!,I did and then I lost it due 2 my mental health and other health issues

Anyone else feel like they want to run away and not look back even if it means leaving your whole world behind and the only thing that‚Äôs holding you back is that you have no where else to go? #mindgames,I tell if your overwhelmed find a place where you can run away for the whole day if it‚Äôs just to rest okay if it‚Äôs to plan for things you would never do that‚Äôs okay must be rated G the point is to leave every thing behind and enjoy that day give yourself a day to run away every month one day,I did this and it‚Äôs the worst decision of my life now feeling more isolated and lonely than I‚Äôve ever been so my advice is don‚Äôt do it what ever the issue just talk

"Heya everyone , I just wanted to let you all know i wrote this during hard times to self motivate.
When your filled with unbalance and roughness of your own trauma and stress you may feel up alone in the battle but it's ok to feel that your not ok when your struggling to get yourself pulled together in your trauma and tensions being lost missing stages of yourself anxiety is the only thing that you could have allowed to take hold to allow you to be battles giving to your trauma. I don't know how to cope with going forth to my own issues if I can't look and figure solutions out I am seriously tearing up inside myself cause of my own trauma and there's nothing to help me cope and it's ok to not cope and not feel ok I know I'm only alone in my tensions battles and it's better to have me alone isolated and alone coping pains and traumatic stress of everything then letting it not be balanced out in a way. I am so fed up and running down to tears in myself often to know how to keep fighting my emotions inside myself.","Rather than fighting your emotions, observe them. 
At some point you will realise that they are just emotions and then you can use them to motivate yourself.

I can say it has improved my daily attitude, I'm more focused and feeling less trauma, even the PTSD has gone.  You don't do it to trip, you take a mini dose to ease your brain receptors. So if you're looking for a reliable source where you can get quality products and also proper information on how to microdose properly, I'll advice you reach out to trips.Jaxon on Instagram for such, he has been a great therapist and microdosing tutor to me...

"Hi, I was wondering if you can offer me some help and advice please. Sorry for long post.
My husband of 15 years was running our restaurant for the last 8 years. He was the pillar of this business,  working lots of hours, dealing with problems and the stresses of running business like that. I was mainly in the background and looking after the house and kids, occasionally taking active role in running of the business.
Additionally, our son was born 6 years ago and has got a life limiting heart condition which meant long hospital stays, 3 open heart surgeries, lots of hospital visits ect. This really affected us as a family. 
Recently my husband started behaving rather erratically. He kept saying to me on more than one occasion that our staff is doing everything to ruin our business, they don't listen to him, do opposite, play tricks on him, then it escalated to accusations that they work on someone's instruction to take over the business, even poison him. I wanted to reason with him, but he started saying that I am behind this too. At some point he refused to go to work, I took over the bast I could.
The accusations started to affect our family life, he is saying our kids are not his (said it to them, they are 6 and 11). They I have a man in my life, my mother is plotting against him, his parents are only using him, kids behave badly. I asked him to leave the house and I refuse to let him come back until he seeks mental health help, but all this is escalating and I am leaning towards divorce. I feel like he needs help, but he refuses and claims he is behaving normally. Gp, mental health crisis team say he needs to consent. I do not know where to turn and how to help him and us. Any suggestions what to do, where to turn please?","If you really believe in Vedic astrology,i have noticed throat and sacral energy chakras blocked in you cause of some toxic enmity around you in the past,if you want me to tell you more in depth you can inbox me with a picture of your right Palm thank you...","I don't normally slide into DM,s strictly only when the universe permits aseüßøüôè‚≠ê"

"I am going through horrible emotional pain and can't stop crying or get out of bed. I helped a man out who was homeless by letting him move in (he was from 2 states away and was going through alot) to which we began a relationship also. I helped him find a jobs and he got on at the volunteer fire dept in my town. Two months in and he began to be lazy, not want to help with bills, and just very emotional unavailable and ungrateful. He had me so drained and disconnected from myself and my kids even noticed it. Well this past Friday he left in the morning for work as usual, gave me a hug and kiss and said I'll see you later but that's the last I heard or saw of him. I called several times with no answer only a text from a weird number saying leave him be.

I have also been researching some things I can do on my own to manage my condition. I look forward to sharing my journey with all of you.",Thank you for your story.

The past 5 weeks I'm having really bad sleep anxiety and panic attacks. Every time I drift off I wake up in a panic within minutes and have to jump out of bed. It feels like I can't breathe and I have to go outside for air. I'm so exhausted from lack of sleep. üò¢,This happened to me after a traumatic event in 1990. Doctor gave me medication with nasty side effects so i gave it up. I felt just like you. I had migraine I.b.s. As soon as I closed my eyes I started having nightmares. I think it was p.t.s.d. In 1994 I tried medication again and am still on it now. The secret was to start on a lower dose and build up slowly. Before going on medication I was often bed bound but symptoms did start to subside. I also have m.e.,I get the same panik attacks anxiety I suffer from bipolar disorder I've been struggling lots with my mental health and I have to search for a flat as I live in a temporary accommodation and that gives me even more anxiety and I get very stressed and I even don't have a support worker or a care coordinator I'm struggling lots since I came out the hospital last summer on section 3

"Hi guys, this is the first time I'll ever share my real feelings with nyone, so please forgive me if I cross boundaries.

At this point, I feel I should accept that I'll have low self esteem for the rest of my life. I'll never be able to fix it.

I cant afford therapy. And im worried that the low cost or free therapist won't be able to help me with my issues. Plus, I'm scared od being open and vulnerable with them. It's like I'm giving them do much power over me. Control. They can do anything to me. Abd they might even abuse their power by gaslightjng me. I feel like some have god complexes.

I feel like im in prison. Every day. Serving life.

Sometimes, I wish I was a narcissist or sociopath. I can't take this anymore. I have a lot of anger, cynicism and low self esteem. I would rather let myself be killed by someone. Which I pray for every night. When I look in the mirror, I feel like vomiting. My face repulsed me.

I like hurting myself emotionally. I find it fun in a way.. It makes me feel a little tingly. I love insulting and destroying my self esteem. I love hurting. I know, it sounds bad, but I can't help it.

I regret the day I even touched john bradshaws homecoming. What was i thinking? Trying to fix my trauma. I should've just stayed in my lie. I wish I could pretend that my life was perfect, regardless of how my family used me. I'm a fool. I never should've opened that book. 

I was a fool. Such a fool. I knew deep down this was hopeless.

Who was I to think that there would actually be people who cared about me. I'll never fins someone who cares about me genuinely. I mean, I've never had friends or romantic relationships in my 21 years on this planet.
I have no one in my life. I've never had anyone to care about.

I've come to realize something. Even though my mom is narcissistic, she really is the only person in the world who actually cares about me. I mean, there's no one else I the world who will love me like she did. She's the only person who genuinely cares about me. No one will ever love me. Even if I was a tool, at least she notices that I exist. She was there when the rest of society rejected me.",Google crisis centers in your area.

Also there is a thing called right to choose, when if you have been reffered you have a right to choose a dr / service. Might be worth googling, sometime they used to be able to refer you to other services / (including pvt)  hopefully have shorter waiting lists.

It‚Äôs hard to help yourself and learn about how best to cope but you can manage it while you wait and go to the appointment armed with loads to back up you reasons for the assessment use you time wisely while you wait I record my seizures and all sorts I record meltdowns from the kids etc it all helps them to see day to day living not just assess you in 10 mins with no evidence xx hope you get seen sooner xx"

Hi I‚Äôm new here and posting anonymously due to not wanting people to know about my mental health. I need some advice from anyone who has experience psychosis or schizophrenia. 

I have BPD and it has been diagnosed for 4-5 years. I used to be on an anti-psychotic called Quetiapine and also an anti depressant Sertraline but I came off these about a year ago. 

Basically, I‚Äôve been really paranoid about things due to my trust being broken by a lot of people, childhood trauma ect I probably have PTSD!! 

An incident happened on Friday where I basically worked myself up over absolutely nothing but I believed everything my head was telling me. I then started to feel really weird and thought I had hyper ventilated which caused mt to go light headed but I realised I wasn‚Äôt breathing any faster and mt heart was a normal pace. I wasn‚Äôt having a panic attack either. 

I started pacing and shaking my hands saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm here‚Äù. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt in control of my body. I couldn‚Äôt hear any back ground noises like the cars driving past or the telling, I literally felt like I was in the back of my head and couldn‚Äôt feel my body. 

Then I tried to force myself to sleep to which I found my eyes didn‚Äôt want to shut and we‚Äôre doing their own thing like looking around and then I started to not just think I saw a dark figure but I FELT a dark figure stood behind my in the door way. I also kept hearing noises. 

My head continued to feel like it wasn‚Äôt even on my shoulders. I kept saying to my friend ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm here I‚Äôm scared‚Äù. I kept turning the light on because I felt like my eyes every now and again would ‚Äúblack out‚Äù when they shut for a quick second. It‚Äôs really hard to explain. 

I realised I had probably severely dissociated to the point I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúcome back‚Äù and it really scared me. My head was bringing up random things and talking and I‚Äôd believe it all and the thought would lead to a next thought and the next and so on. In about 10 seconds I‚Äôd probably had 100+ thoughts just leading on and on from each other. 

I eventually forced myself to sleep at 4am because I was exhausted. I woke up an hour later with my head still feeling the same like I wasn‚Äôt here at all. 

I was secretly confused at was reality and what was my head thinking of scenarios or even dreaming. I didn‚Äôt know if what I was feeling or thinking was rea which was also really scary. Again, I want to mention my eyes were literaly doing their own thing! 

I then woke up in the morning better but still not completely with it. I forced an anti psychotic down myself and just slept till I felt better. 

I know with BPD some of this is normal and so are seeing dark shadows when off medication but I generally believed in my own head and body that I FELT someone stood in the door way. I must of looked crazy constantly twitching from under the quilt to look and see who was there. 

But I really want is someone to tell me what happened to me. Im worried I may of had like an episode of psychosis or if I maybe have schizophrenia I just don‚Äôt know. Someone please help üò© 

Im re referring myself to the mental health access hub this morning because IAPT say my case is too complex and the secondary mental health team say im too mentally unstable for seeing a psychologist. Im sorry but it‚Äôs quite obvious I need help because im getting worse. 

Any help or advice appreciate üôèüèºüôèüèº",Were  you off your medication if yes that‚Äôs probably the reason why you went through all that horrible things you saw and heard  I hope you are going to a psychiatric hospital to get back on your medication I heard some people when they start to feel better on medication feel they don‚Äôt need it anymore then they get off of it an th symptoms start all over again get well listen to doctors nurses and social workers and stay on your medication,I have severe unstable personality disorder with a psychosis. I do take an anti psychotic and tablets for extreme anxiety and depression. I also get how you have gotten I'm awake but can never remember a thing that happens . Sometimes I'm ok and come around easily but others I'm so bad that my partner gets really scared  I've never hurt anyone I always hurt myself and its been seriously bad. I would keep some kind of diary if you can  I don't understand why you are not seeing a psychologist  I have one and I have to see them every 3 months because of the severity. They have determined that I will never get better and I have to try to live and cope the best way I can with mine . Please push to be referred to a mental health specialist because you really don't want things to escalate. I'm here to talk if you have questions x

does anyone know why or have any ideas why i sometimes text some people too much? is it bc of an attachment disorder or something? (just taking a guess about the reason)",Because you feal alone darling and maybe you don't want other people to feal that way so you text them and theirs no harm in that I'd rather have someone text me 100 times a day showing me they care rather than not at all,"I have this too

"I‚Äôm not sure about anyone else but I feel overwhelmed and have become so passive. This is not how I normally am. Honestly wondering why I‚Äôm still around. The answer I come up with is other people need me in their lives. It just doesn‚Äôt feel right, like I get used up and I have no energy or motivation to do anything for myself. I ask myself, is this all there is?!?!","Put yourself first, before others. Invest in yourself before you can expect to be there for others. I learned this the hard way. Everything else won't matter if you can't be in the right place mentally. It'll eventually break you, unexpectedly. I changed the way I thought and do things. I come first. It's selfish, yeah, but it's what's best for me. And it could be what's best for you, since you can put in the work to make sure you are in the best version of you, so you can offer that person to others.","I have to say, I seriously thought about it and decided I HAVE to come first when it comes to care. I also made an appointment with my dr and we discovered a side effect of one of my meds was breaking down my muscles. Took me off it and with the kind words from people here, I‚Äôm feeling so much better! Thank you all for taking the time out of your day to help a stranger. I truly appreciate it!"
It hurts my heart so much that my partner is relapsing and not one person will help her what will it take for some one to listen and help,"It's your partner, if no one else will help, then you need to step up and manage the situation, if they need medical attention get them to a hospital or call an ambulance, that should be obvious!

I found myself drawing very terrifying things and um okay this may seem silly but I roleplay with Ai apps for fun and therapy I created my own original charaxter( which I gotta draw later) and I have the most traumatic and triggering backstory for her and in a way it helps so much whenever I feel anger or I feel my possible BPD kick in 

It‚Äôs like venting in a form feels so nice 

I only posted this because I wanna see what you fellas do and um what more hobbies I can add into self therapy  

So suggest me stuff if ya can thanks. üíô","I think it depends if it's a natural thought of a thing that happens, or if you go looking for the dark things. 
I write sometimes - short stories, poems, training and coaching things and even websites. 
But sometimes when I start free writing the most dark things come out. Murder, sex, violence. 
But that's ok cos it is offset with all the nice things I write and do. 
But if I was to start each session by asking myself what dark thing can I write today - well that makes it a more conscious form of darkness, more real. Whereas, when it does come out of me, it's the subconscious, it's like a purge of thoughts, experiences, the world news etc.",I just go for long walks

Dont take onboard their problems as this will relieve some of the stress.  It will minimise what you can deal with.  

It would be good for you to recognise your baby by giving the baby a name.   That way youve named your baby even with a miscarriage.   There are many options to place a memorial, a plant eg rose in the garden that you can visit.  Also alot of hospitals have a grief and loss counsellor.   You could also do the same for your sister."

Initially it worked and hed start packing his bags, sending me into a tailspin (hello, abandonment issues). Eventually he did this so often that i would literally roll my eyes and be like ""ok, here we go again"", Eventually he realized that this didn't work. I definitely grey rocked him without even knowing what it was. I would accuse him so often of cheating, but he would conclude that it was me going ""you're imagining things""
""you have issues""you're upset over nothing"".

"I love this question. If you could be anything, I mean anything. What would you be? Remember, what you say tells me alot about you. üòâ Comment below üëá","Somehow educate people about how to have a productive discussions with others, especially with those who have different views and opinions. This is especially important now we can speak to anyone about anything, online, without knowing or seeing the person you are talking to. 
If only people knew how beneficial it is for themselves and everyone else. I'm sure they would do it. 
I'm not influential enough to make much of a difference but if I was, that's what I would be advocating.
Sometimes even a question, or questions, that are asked of peiple or groups of people, have insult or bigotry or dehumanization woven into the very asking.

People often feel really frustrated by the beliefs, views and opinions ions  of others and feel that they have to ""correct"" them, and in doing so they can come across as condescending, patronising and aggressive. And not always accidentally!   
 Its a shame that much online debating/discussing seems to have descended into the kind of arguments you might hear in a school playground: ""You're stupid"", ""No, you're stupid for calling me stupid"".
We would all do well to remember that there are myriad social, economic, cultural and educational factors that determine what and how people think. 
It's important to understand each other and to talk with and listen to what others say. There's room enough for all of our views and discussion with a view to understanding oeopkes mindset (not the same as agreeing) is how we manage to find the best answers to issues that affect us all in different ways.  
nothing changes without  that and it's important not only to let others know what WE think but to understand how OTHERS think. No one person has all rhe answers to problems that exist and divide society.  
So by all means people should certainly carry on talking about their opinions/views and beliefs, and challenging other people about theirs but I would encourage  thinking the what it is they are trying to achieve. If its to he taken seriously, be heard or help solve the big issues of the time, its not just about telling people what you think and dismissing what others think as if has no worth. This has no positive impact on anyone including the individual trying to get their message across. 
We are all aware that how we say things is often as important, if not more so, than what we say. So in order to utilise the resources we bow have to talk to each other, it would be great if we all knew how to make the most and get the best out of it. 
Maybe schools could teach young people about how to do this since so much of our modern day lives are conducted via the internet. It seems odd that people are unaware of how and why they should use it correctly, especially when researching information and interacting with others on social media.

Thank u for listening ‚ù§Ô∏èxx",Please get some support or ring any mental health helpline initially and speak to your GP about how you are feeling.,I so sorry you have had these problems. Don't worry about the past you can't change. Make up with your son and say sorry for making a judgement. In time he will forgive you. Concentrate on your own social life and hobbies. See more of your friends and make new ones. You are a good generous person. Keep going down that road. Be kind. Good luck

"Hello all, looking for advice. I‚Äôm 29, I‚Äôve been in a relationship for 6 years but it‚Äôs just come to an end. It was her decision. Long story short I became friends with a lady but as I‚Äôm a guy she says I can‚Äôt be trusted as she knows what men are like. She is friends with loads of men but I have to accept it?
I am really struggling with the disconnect. 
She tells me if she could flick a switch and make everything okay again she would, she tells me that she still loves me but is enjoying her life more now she is out of the relationship. 
I am clinging onto the little hope that one day she will turn around and give me another chance but I am hurting so much in the process. 
I have been diagnosed with situational depression due to this as I am seriously struggling with it.

I don‚Äôt know what to do? I want to be with her, but I feel like I‚Äôm wasting time and hurting in the process

Any advice would be great","Let her go. Respect her boundary.

Is it manly to have a affectionate nature and want love? I haven't had that kind of thing for a long time or what seems a long time. I just feel lonely and uncomfortable being a single man.

I miss having someone to wake up with and especially during the Christmas period.,"Be patient, it can take time to find the special one for you. You have all the right qualities.

But it did
I can‚Äôt say exactly when in my grieving process it just happened slowly and done days i felt like you do now (a week is v short to get over thisüòä)
But as I say in time and making a new life for just me it faded
Not saying it disappeared but the pain got less and I was able to move on
My suggestion is grieve cry shout get drunk if that‚Äôs your thing - but between that find something new to do. 
Something you‚Äôd never done together
Might be a small thing like adult colouring but find something you like to do
Small steps wirk best from my own experience
Not sure that‚Äôs ever so helpful but I know you can get through this and eventually you might go back to being good friends given time and space and patience

"In the last 24 hours, ive had to take a proper and deep look inside myself to identify a trigger and a reason for the behaviour that comes with the trigger.

Ive realised that I have quite severe rejection sensitivity. I know its because I was physically and mentally abused and emotionally neglected when I was a child.. I know that.
But how do I stop this? How do I stop feeling like this? How do I train my emotional brain to stop seeing rejection in everyone's behaviour towards me? How do I train my emotional brain to believe in myself? To believe that I am actually loved? How do I stop seeing certain behaviours as rejection, and just see things as they are? How do I stop trying to reject people because I believe they will reject me first?

"Hi 
I would introduce myself but really i want to be anonymous in this case. 
I'm male around 25 year old. 
I've suffered from depression some years ago and sometimes (like today) it comes back. Each time is more manageable but it's getting hard. From original depression it was harder and harder for me to cry... I was not suppressing it, it just went that way. Today is the first time when I realized that I'm not able to cry. I want ... But i can not. 

To be precised I will NOT hurt myself and don't take my words like that. Life is just getting shittier every year for me. Multiple work life failures, only one true relationship where I loved my partner and lots of mining less shit since the brake up years ago.

I can't say that anything has changed except the way I'm feel cause I'm not coping.   I'm seriously considering seeing my GP.  
I know it's stupid and it probably a man thing because i dont usual talk about things especially to a stranger but I am scared stiff they will just think I'm being stupid.
Can anyone tell me what it's like the first time you see the GP for depression.  I'm sure they are good I just need some reassurance.

"I‚Äôve suffered for 12 years and never received a diagnosis. Just get illnesses written down with a question mark next to them on my medical records ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not helpful as I need to know how to manage it!
My symptoms are: 
- every now and then (could be monthly or every couple of months) get very depressed, cannot cope and need looking after by my partner/ or mum, but when they come home to look after me I quickly become very positive (as if them being there is all I needed) 
- I can get highs but they don‚Äôt last long at all, changes very quickly, where I feel ‚Äòbuzzing‚Äô and just want sex, I‚Äôd literally have sex with anyone at that point 
- I‚Äôm impulsive with spending, won‚Äôt spend on things I need or bills etc but just on things that give me a temporary buzz 
- I have severe anxiety, always think something bad will happen, or someone will hurt me 
- I have severe mood swings, I can tell my partner I‚Äôm going to leave him and will tell family how much I hate him, but then minutes later love him so much and he‚Äôs the best thing in the world‚Ä¶ 

Does this sound like anyone else? Any idea what it is?

"Hi everybody. Thank you for adding me to this site.
I have been suffering with serious depression and severe anxiety and was also diagnosed with anti social personality disorder. I lost my dad to dementia last year Novembef after I moved home years before to help mom look after him, then in early 2020. Unfortunately I got Covid which gave me water on the organs, liver, kidney problems, clot on thd lung and heart failure, so that stopped me helping as much as I could. I look and care for mom now and just lost my close Uncle two days ago who was my dads elder brother.
Everyday has been a struggle as you all know it takes 100% effort anyway but now mom has give up, I have no support or friends but been used by many which has cost me mentally and money wise. I feel that I have a sign on my head saying help yourself and make fun, call me names like fat git and alot worse, it must say use me!
I am known as the moaner, so can't win
53 and from 15 battling and tried CBT, every theropy going. Had a psychologist and psy chiatrist for over 20 years. Now on my own, caring for mom with no future. So now just gave up. I have tried but I get the above attitude.
There is no answer.","There's online courses you could go for, online groups you could join, groups on Facebook you could join, see if there's a coffee group in your area, a walking group, etc",I would love a group round this area but there are not any and I have to be at the call of my mom and others for some reason or my life becomes hell.
"What do you do when you feel like you can't get close to anyone because they will leave (or die) ? 

What to do when it's been going on as far back as you can remember?","You learn to get comfortable with being alone, you open the door occasionally to let someone in, but you always expect they will go out too.
You also remember that if the company of someone gives you pleasure, the loss of that person is the price you pay for the pleasure.
There is no pleasure without pain","I would seek out a therapist.  Life is too short to worry about the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and yes, people do pass but we still live our lives."

"I've just accepted a new job and the same day I found out I'm 5 weeks pregnant. My partner is over the moon ecstatic, however I'm just miserable. Its really not the time. Mentally I dont think I can cope with this, I'm currently in crisis management and waiting on a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. I cant go through with an abortion as was in a bad situation years ago that has given me PTSD. I'm just feeling trapped, overwhelmed and honestly I'm just feeling so guilty for feeling this way. Most people would be ecstatic but for myself I just feel like each blow is another nail in the coffin for my mental health. I just dont know what to do. My partner thinks I'll just stop feeling like this and be excited soon I just cant see that happening at the moment",You need to talk to people about it. Get support. You can work and have a baby. How old are you?,I would suggest to speak to a counselling service that specialise with pregnancy support.
"Hi I'm hoping for some advice if possible?

I've been in and out of therapy/meds for around 12 years now and was out of therapy/meds for 4ish years but feel like I've took a drastic dive.

I've called up my local talking therapies which referred me onto a community team which did an assessment and they basically come out with borderline personality disorder which has something that's been back and forth over years along with bi-polar (however bi-polar was ruled out) but in the end it's always been put down to depression and anxiety 

They've now referred me to enhanced psychological therapies and I need an initial assessment to see if they will be able to meet my needs ect and possible looking into another assessment. 

Sorry for the long post put is anyone been through something similar and give me an idea of what I can expect?

I keep thinking what if I'm just wasting their time and someone else might need it more thatln me? Anxiety is through the roof and was hoping to see if anyone knew what to expect?

Sorry if not allowed- and thanks for any advice you may be able to give ü©∑",i am bipolar and only doctors can diagnose u im also border line personality u dont need to worry about other patients worry about ur own health u need to be there for a reason and start taking ur meds,"I'll recommend you reach out to  recharld.trppy on Instagram he will be of much help to you.

"Hi everybody, relatively new to the group. First of all, I admire everybody for coming here and opening up and seeking help. It takes great strength and courage to do that so well done everybody.

"I've been battling major depression since I was 15, am now 46. Lately is getting worse, enhancing other issues like OCD, ADHD... It's a battle combined with taking care of my parents, with dementia. 
I'm at my last breath.
Need to quit my job so I can focus on myself and my parents, but it's a struggle to pay the bills and get another job after healing... No jobs as you get older",Hi I can help you out please connect with me on inbox,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a challenging time. It's clear that you're dealing with multiple layers of difficulty, and it's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being. Here are a few suggestions that might help you navigate these tough circumstances:

Seek Professional Help:

Reach out to mental health professionals such as therapists, counselors, or psychiatrists. They can provide you with the support and guidance needed to manage depression, OCD, and ADHD.
Consider discussing medication options with a healthcare professional if they believe it might be beneficial for your mental health.
Build a Support System:

Connect with friends, family, or support groups. Sharing your struggles with others can provide emotional support and help alleviate feelings of isolation.
Self-Care:

Make self-care a priority. This can include activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and a sense of peace. It's crucial to take care of yourself, especially when dealing with the challenges of caring for parents with dementia.
Explore Financial Assistance:

Look into available financial assistance programs or services that may be able to support you during this difficult time. Government agencies, non-profit organizations, or community resources might be able to provide assistance.
Job Transition:

If you're considering leaving your current job, explore options for part-time or flexible work that allows you to balance your caregiving responsibilities and take care of your mental health.
Plan and Budget:

Create a realistic budget that takes into account your financial needs and explore ways to cut unnecessary expenses. Financial counselors may be able to help you with this process.
Explore New Job Opportunities:

If and when you decide to look for a new job, consider your skills and experience. There are opportunities for older individuals in various fields, and networking can be a valuable resource.
Community Resources:

Reach out to local community resources, social services, or charitable organizations that may offer assistance, advice, or support for individuals facing challenging circumstances.
Legal and Financial Advice:

Consider seeking legal and financial advice to understand your options, especially if you're contemplating leaving your job. There may be legal protections or financial strategies that can help you navigate this transition.
Remember that it's okay to ask for help and that taking care of your mental health is a priority. If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a mental health crisis hotline or a local mental health emergency service. You're not alone, and there are people and resources available to support you."

I was in that locked ward for 4 month while they figured out a new med cocktail to make me present again.  I Never wanted to goo through that again, so we  started the daily checkins. and when I startwd bwing OFF mom would ask me to Talk to my Psych Doctorbto adjust my meda,

"14 months ago my husband turned our world upside down - he left the family home . 
Previously we had done what we could to make him happy, hosted bbqs for his mates went to concerts, shopping etc. 
he had been ‚Äòmoody‚Äô to the extreme for 2 months before going. 
Turns out his mood was guilt- he had found pleasure else where, and had done several times in the 30 year marriage. Since leaving he has had several relationships with sex workers and even moved in with one. 
He won‚Äôt talk to his grown up children, stating via text that that‚Äôs their choice. 
He‚Äôs made getting a Divorce hard work and has left me in financial hardship.
Why is it so hard to get divorces and have financial independence from someone like this (narcissistic).

Being by yourself is NOT a bad thing, it is a time to find out who you really are. Ask God/ Universe, what it is that you are showing me? Being by yourself is a blessing not a curse. You need to take a deep breath and be grateful for what you have and how far you have come. You are taking a HUGE step by reaching out to people. That is the first step. Maybe you can go and get Therapy, so you can express yourself with, if not writing things down on paper is a way you can see what you need to do.

"Hy there. I'm new! Actually I was looking for a group like this as I have a mental breakdown.
To the Situation: I'm doing LARP (live action roleplay) imagen a fantasy game, only that it's real live and you are playing out your character like in an impro theater.
So I was part of this FB group and asked for cons on a specific date. As I play a high fantasy creatur and not every con wants these I also posted a pic of my character.
It startet with laughing faces and went on with not very nice comments, about how my character isn't good for anything...
Keep in mind that that character means a lot o me. I made a lot of her costume myselfe such as the staff she caries...

I'm normally okay with such things. If I post a pic I can accept a little backlash.
Thenther was this very long comment that on first sight was nice and friendly and even gave me a site with con dates. I thanked him and concentrated on something else.
2h or so later I open FB and read a comment under my thanks that said ""who is going to tell her?""
I read the comment again and discovered that it was sarcasm. Very clearly even. But I didn't see that at forst because I just thought (or wanted to think) that there is at least one nic person in that group.

So as I said normally I don't care about the opinion of others. But for the question of con dates I only got hate over my costume.
I was now at home for 4 months as I'm not doing very good with my mental health.
I'm lying in bed and cry. I haven't had such a episode in a long time now...
I just can't understand why people are so mean. I would never laugh at someone about their character or anything else. You never know what they are going through.

Sry for the wall of text but i needed that...","The comments are getting a little unsupportive on this post unfortunately.

X,"I haven't heard of it, but I'd be interested to read it if you find a copy.","I‚Äôm a victim of domestic violence,My husband started spending a lot of time with his friends from childhood whom I had never met or heard of before.  Sometime last month I just woke up and asked to see his phone to check the time. He handed it to me and it opened into WhatsApp, where I discovered he had been sending naked photos of himself to someone. When he realized he had handed me his unlocked phone, he pounced on me, snatched his phone back, and smashed it on the floor, but I had already seen it. As it turns out, he'd been chatting with someone but I decided not to question him. I wasn't sure how to react cause I didn't even get a chance to know who he was texting on the other end. I saw a touching story here of how someone found out her husband was cheating, I decided to contact the hacker she recommended through a link she posted here, he cloned my husband's phone without physically touching it. All I did was send his phone number to him and . a remote link sent to my mail, I was able to access all of his texts, emails, Facebook and Instagram chats, real-time call listening and his long deleted messages as if the phone was physically with me after reading his chats I found out he was texting a younger woman in his office and it was clear that they regularly had sex, I have no idea how long he has been doing this cause they had developed an emotional connection.

Sometime last month I just woke up and asked to see his phone to check the time. He handed it to me and it opened into WhatsApp, where I discovered he had been sending naked photos of himself to someone. When he realized he had handed me his unlocked phone, he pounced on me, snatched his phone back, and smashed it on the floor, but I had already seen it. As it turns out, he'd been chatting with someone but I decided not to question him. I wasn't sure how to react cause I didn't even get a chance to know who he was texting on the other end. I saw a touching story here of how someone found out her husband was cheating, I decided to contact the hacker she recommended through a link she posted here, he cloned my husband's phone without physically touching it. All I did was send his phone number to him and . a remote link sent to my mail, I was able to access all of his texts, emails, Facebook and Instagram chats, real-time call listening and his long deleted messages as if the phone was physically with me after reading his chats I found out he was texting a younger woman in his office and it was clear that they regularly had sex, I have no idea how long he has been doing this cause they had developed an emotional connection. Perhaps, you are in a similar situation and you need help or you just crave that extra teeny bit of closure, you can get in touch with him on  Instagram @Alex_tools11"

Hi. I am new to the group & new to mental health struggles. Looking to make new friends who know what I am going through.,Good morning,Iam going through the same thing and are getting bad thoughts
,Hi there. I had a good day yesterday. I finally cured my new phone daymare and realised a few things about myself. I've always been wary of technology and because I did it myself I have more confidence to do it again. Success is failure turned inside out.

Mental health not so good,Mine was horrible at the beginning I have been in counseling off and on for twenty  years it has gotten better I still have sad days and days when something triggers my ptsd. Or when I get overwhelmed with things seem to be happening over and over again,If it‚Äôs not good the best thing is to talk about  your mental health this is a good group and very supportive you also can get a therapist and a psychiatrist also I would start with a counselor first until you‚Äôre comfortable

Hey everyone X hope you are all ok xx just wanted to ask if anyone has had a mental health assessment through the access team at the hospital mental health department and knows what happens next in terms of being contacted back in regards to the assessment and support available etc I had the assessment mid November but I'm not on any medication or treatment for my mental Illnesses due to my GP not considering it a good idea until I was assessed by the relevant professionals this because of the extent of which my psychological state of mind deteriorated. I'm just confused about what happens next and wondered if anyone has any advice for me please thanks in advance xx,Give the Access Team a call and ask them. Generally after an assessment they will determine whether you are at risk enough to admit and if not they will close the file. Sometimes they will refer you to community mental health for follow up.,If the Access team deem you are a serious risk to your well being they would attempt to find a bed for you in the mental health unit. If not they might refer you to the community team and a member from there would get it touch with you. Alternatively they might refer you back to your GP suggesting a mental health care plan where you would receive a number of sessions free of charge with a mental health practitioner. The access team should have told you what their plan was. As Sonja said give them a call to clarify the situation. Don't fear the MHU I worked there for 5 years and it is one of the best in the state.
Are there any professionals on here where we can get genuine help and advice please? Thank you,Thank youüôÇ,If the issue is BPD I can maybe help

"I Just joined this group because I‚Äôve found myself with nowhere left to turn. I‚Äôm not one who likes to make his problems public, but when it comes down to it, I don‚Äôt trust therapists, or really any professional for that matter. I don‚Äôt really have any friends I can speak to. I do a great job of making everything look like it‚Äôs okay and I don‚Äôt want to ruin that illusion for my family. That‚Äôs kinda the reason this post is anonymous. But the truth is that I‚Äôm really not ok. I would say life has taken a turn for the worse, but that would imply things were going well to begin with. I have been so distraught that I can‚Äôt even eat at this point. Life just seems so hopeless and meaningless with no signs of things getting better anytime soon. I‚Äôm watching my relationship fall apart despite my best efforts to keep it together. What was once a promising job has since become dead-end with no possibility of improving. I‚Äôve gone from a straight A student to struggling to maintain a C. And it seems that every effort I make to improve the areas of my life I feel need the most work, ends up in me taking two steps backwards. I‚Äôve always been very mentally resilient and able to move past the hard times, but now I just feel hopeless. I don‚Äôt feel happy anymore. I have been trying to avoid using the word depressed, but I just feel so deeply saddened by the state of things at this point that I‚Äôm not sure what other word to use. Maybe despondent? I guess the whole purpose behind me making this post is me trying to give myself one small tiny sliver of hope that maybe things can get better in life, but truthfully, I don‚Äôt see that as a possibility. The job I want in life doesn‚Äôt want me, the relationship I‚Äôve been so invested in for the last few years is fading away and all I can do is watch, and the worst part is I have absolutely nobody to talk to about it. I‚Äòve tried talking to a therapist but it didn‚Äôt work well. I don‚Äôt trust them and I don‚Äôt trust the idea of ‚Äúoh just try another one and another one and another one and another one and another one until you‚Äôve spent your life savings trying out 137 different therapists‚Äù. I guess I‚Äôll end this with a plead for someone out there who took the time to read this, who really wishes to try and help me at least have a little hope in life, and who can make me feel like I can be happy again because I haven‚Äôt been happy for a long time and I don‚Äôt know how to be anymore. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm advance for such a rant and for being so heavily impacted by these relatively trivial issues","Trust goes both ways I was married for 23 years my ex left me the very first time I entered a. psych hospital was left feeling abandoned and my trust in people went downhill it took me alone time to trust a therapist but I found one and bit by bit I was able to tell her my story she never judged I still have problems  with being abandoned
Ôøºyou are making a big step in telling your story it‚Äôs a brave thing to do if you trust yourself to post your story on Facebook maybe you will try another therapist there‚Äôs lots of different kinds if you decide to go to a therapist tell that person your feeling of trust be honest I am going to an outpatient program that I attend three days a week three hours a day you can listen to others speak and when you comfortable you can talk","If you are a bit open and committed, please look into this.
Go to Youtube and search for ""Inner Engineering - Finding the Source of Your Happiness"".
Do the practice ""Inner Engineering"".
I believe it will stabilise your emotion and give your mental clarity. 
PS: If you are rich, you can spend on many therapists."
"So in March 22nd my toxic workplace intensified to the point I no longer felt my mental health was safe.  I applied for FMLA and took every bit of that approved time to heal. I was diagnosed with chronic ptsd, depression and anxiety. I have been going to therapy regularly throughout and it‚Äôs been helpful in helping me understand my reactions to others negative behavior. People really be doing dumb shit. 
Anyway I‚Äôm about to begin another job, less stress and a little less pay which is fine. I‚Äôve been off for over 3 months and I‚Äôm struggling with the question, ‚Äúam I ready?‚Äù  
I‚Äôm medicated, but I haven‚Äôt really learned any healthy ways to bring down the over production of stress hormones in confrontational situations. I don‚Äôt plan to have any as I‚Äôm easy to get along with but my last experience in the workforce really did a number on me.

"I'm miserable at the moment. I'm so tired of just being on my phone, nearly every waking second and being alone. I wanna live, enjoy life, explore, hang out with friends, travel, do something different every day. But I'm stuck,  I'm in poverty and there's just nothing I can do. Plus, I don't have any real friends. 

I guess, I have only myself to blame for being in this situation. I wasn't diligent about a career, not settling down anywhere long enough permanently. I gave up on friendships, because I became a independent free spirit of a loner. I'm regretting it all. Especially the later. There's just no doubt, I don't want to be alone anymore. I want friends and possibly a love interest. It's not too much to ask, but it's gonna take effort. Maybe, I just shouldn't have been a 'rolling stone' it's got me nowhere in life. I've settled down in a city, where I don't know anyone. I find it hard to make and develop new friendships. 

A life spent on a mobile/cell phone üì± daily is definitely no life at all. There's more to life, a world out there and I'm stuck on my phone. Due to poverty and a lack of real close friendships. I'm feeling sorry for myself. If anyone is free at all, I would appreciate a chat. I'm emotional and I need support. So very sorry I sound pathetic, needy and clingy. 

Wishing you all blessed good  mental health and a good weekend.",Hey there are you able to leave the house and be confident enough to start an activity I.e sport or class like art etc or just get out in fresh air at parks to start with if not.

"Hi all. I got an accident on monday the 19th at 10am. I was coming from the market crossed the road and passed between 2 parked  buses at the back. Unfortunately, one reversed while i was crossing and squeezed me towards the parked one. I started screaming for help, i could not move, it kept reversing, i could not escape, the pain on my waist thighs and legs was too much that i was numb, i was screaming and what hurts me the most, it was in broad daylight and people were WATCHING ME SCREAM, as i was seconds away from death. I did not even think of praying my last prayers. I only thought of how my child will be motherless. Eventually, the driver heard my scream and drove frontwards where i was released and fell down. So many people crowded there, i was in 
Pain, i was crying begging the idlers to take me to hospital, luckily, God sent an angel. A guy who new me and called me by name and i asked him to take me to hosp and call my family. I have soft tissue injuries amd muscle trauma, i have been on bedrest, mentally tortured and i do not know how to cope with this. I keep remembering how i saw myself dying, how people are heartless how the watched me without even shouting or alarming the driver that he was 
Crushing me as he was reversing more and more. !! This case was reported but the driver is not cooperating, the pain i was in i honestly dint care of justice or not but ssince now am much better, i have 3 days only to decide whether to proceed with this case and sue the driver and owner of the bus. I feel like its gotta take a long time till i get compensated here l, its a long process.  Am mentally tortured, i was 2 seconds from being crushed to death as people WATCHED?!?! THIS image is really disturbing me. I havent even healed by the fact that i lost my dad on dec 3rd 2023, he was killed by people we know well and guess what?! No JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED. NO one was arrested, my dad died, we buried him.
Am really stressed,am an only child to my mum. Am jobless. Am hurt. I feel drained. Stressed. I donno what to do. I feel like i failed my dad, and am failing myself by not pushing for justice for the accident i had...

"I used to be a train driver but in 2020 someone laid across the tracks in front of me and because of the speed of the train, I was unable to stop in time.  I cried for days after that but when the crying stopped I began to experience things that I know now were not real. After a couple of months of experiencing these delusions I tried to take my own life. I don't know how I became known to the police or social services but suddenly they were knocking on my door and I was sectioned under section 2 of the mental health act. I spent a month under observation in the Warneford hospital in Oxford and another two weeks at a ""step up house"" in Headington.

I eventually returned home and I started to experience the same delusions, and spent the summer of 2020 locked away in my home tormented by the delusions that had gotten me sectioned.

Later that year in late October I had a meeting at the Warneford hospital, Neill unit. After the meeting and still suffering from my delusions I had a meltdown in the car park and was sectioned again under section three of the mental health act. Where I spent another month in hospital. I was released from the secure unit in late November and returned home.

Thankfully this time the delusions stayed away and after a month of being clear of these delusions I returned to work.

I was not cleared to drive a train as my sick leave had been the result of a mental health issue. So I was asked to help out with other duties at Oxford station that were not safety critical, which I was more than happy to do while I waited for a doctors report to clear me to drive trains again.

Eventually I was asked if I could fulfil the role of depot admin, which I did for about a year, while waiting on the doctors report to see if they would let me drive a train again.

While I was waiting to see if I would get the all clear from the doctor. The depot admin role was taken from me and advertised even though I was doing the admin job.

A few weeks went by and the doctors said I was still not stable enough to drive, but now because they had taken the admin job from me I was now on redeployment within the company. The problem with this is that every job I have applied for and even though I am more than qualified for the jobs I have been refused these jobs.

I don't know where to turn to. I feel the company I work for are actively trying to get rid of me and are being dishonest as to the reasons why. If I get redeployed within the company they have to pay me 80% of my former wage, which is an agreement they made with the unions. However, the positions I am applying for are paid a lot less and I feel this is the real reason I am being turned down for jobs I could easily do.

I hope this wasn't too long. Thank you for listening.","Firstly, It's a shame to see this happened to you but good to see that you worked your way through it.

Secondly, I see you're based in Oxford. Assuming this is Oxford, England - there are strict rules around equality and no one can refuse you to do a job because of your mental health (unless deemed unsafe hence the train driving block) so I'd be going to my union to discuss this further, especially if you're applying for jobs you know you can do and are willing to drop pay.",If you have family legal protection on your home insurance they maybe able to help with this üòÄgood luck & sorry you‚Äôve had to go through this

"I could really use some insight. My 19 year old son was recently diagnosed as SchizoEffective Bipolar Disorder. He previously had been diagnosed with ADD, ADHD, Anxiety and he has Type I diabetes.

He did not get ‚Äúfired‚Äù but one he could not lift the required weight, (he only weighs 110 lbs) the other two his anxiety was so great he had to quit. He was having panic attacks so severe that he believed he was having heart attacks. He called the paramedics twice for assistance. They did record an irregularity in his heartbeat. It was later determined by the doctors to be caused by his level of anxiety. I want to be a supportive parent but also encourage him to seek a path towards the best life possible. So far he has NOT sought out street drugs or alcohol to ease his pain for which I am so grateful. My heart is broken for my son.

And our minds ought to be controlled by us and not the other way round. That is where your recovery starts from. We are counseled to guard our hearts with all diligence for our of it comes the issues of life. You can harness the power in your mind by following the steps below:
1. Censor your thoughts. Sieve what thoughts enter your mind. Be conscious of what information you allow into your mind. That is where all the information that enters into you from all the happenings around you per time are processed into thoughts that eventually become actions that hurt you physically and emotionally. 
2. Decongest your mind:  As much as possible begin a process of decongesting your mind now. As you read this, begin to sweep your mind by deliberately weeding out every negative thoughts that have taken root in your mind. 
3. Meditation: Deliberately and consciously start reprogramming your mind with positive thoughts. Think and meditate only on thoughts and situations that have made you happy and joyful before your present condition.
Conclusion: Be very purposeful and deliberate in applying these steps on a daily basis without fail and within the shortest possible time, you will find your out of this present condition. Remember, your mind is your own and only you can control it well. Peace.","Instead of smiling, can you try to express what you‚Äôre really feeling? How do you think they‚Äôll take it?

"Ok I need some advice on what to do. My daughter is incarcerated. She is in the Sevier county jail and is being refused her mental health meds. First they said she had a bad urine test and their protocols said they withheld all medications for 30 days . Then yesterday they told me that she would be receiving her mental health medications and at this point she has mentally deteriorated. The medical personnel I have spoke with outside of the jail says she will continue to deteriorate the longer she goes without her mental health medications. I am here to tell you mental health is serious and if anyone is being treated for it their meds should not be withheld for more than 48 hours. This should be reviewed and not permitted. They can verify the inmates medical records. I just think this is cruel to a person with mental health issues!! Anyone not just my daughter!! She has seizures and they gave her the meds for that which she also has an expired prescription for, but as of today decided she will no longer receive these. I just don't understand why they do this to anyone? She hasn't even been to court to be tried for what she was accused of. What happen to innocent until proven guilty but that is not my worry. How can I get her mental health medications to her and updat her scripts? She has one update script and the nurses opinion is it will make her sleep so they will not give it to her?? It is a mental health med to calm her and stabilize her and because it may let her sleep she will not give it to her? Now she is taking her seizure meds too?? This is just wrong.

"How long to wait after a mental health crisis to make a huge life change?

November 2021, my mental health started declining pretty rapidly after my son turned 1 1/2. (Postpartum depression turned major depression). This led to extreme anger, life-threatening behaviors, and a general lack of ability to cope with everyday life. I was an inpatient in the hospital for a few days twice (August 2022 & November 2022). 

After my last stay, I became internally motivated to get better. Since then, I have been the emotionally healthiest I have ever been. I have made serious changes to my behavior, my outlook, everything, and I‚Äôm thriving. 

This entire time, I‚Äôve been wanting another child, but emotionally, haven‚Äôt been ready, however, now I am. My husband and I have been discussing the possibility of starting to try for another baby in 3-4 months, and I really want to, but I also want to make sure my deep desire for another baby doesn‚Äôt cause me to rush into anything. 

How long would you wait after a mental health crisis to make that kind of a life change?","If you‚Äôre in the U.K., look at referring yourself to Home Start. They are a nationwide support for families with children under 5. You may have a local Facebook page in your area.","It seems like you are in a good place. I don't think you have to look back at the past and worry. Instead you can look at it as a learning curve about going through hard times and getting over it.

"Hi all I need to rant if that's OK. I'm really struggling with one of my children who is daughter age 17.
She has gone off the rails. She has just been diagnosed with the highest adhd and depression but I strongly believe she has a personality disorder too.
It started 2 years ago when she was part of a attempted sexual assault and police never found him. Then she had no support in school from this and she was bullied for what happened. She soon dropped out of school which was her last year and just before doing her gcses.she was self-harming by cutting her arms and legs up. She then enrolled in collage as she really wanted to be a equine veterinary surgeon but girls there was jealous of how much she knew and could ride (we own 4 and she rides 3 of them plus other peoples) she had a girl there who was always telling others they was going to jump my daughter and beat her. Roll on a few weeks later and my daughter text me begging me to come get her as she went toilet and come back to a knife in her bag. The police was called before she had even text me again and then I rang her and a police officer told me that they was called because a student has said they see my daughter with a knife (funny enough it was the girl who was picking on my kid) she was kicked out even tho she said over a d over it wasn't hers and begged them to look for finger prints. She then started to cut more and more and started taking pills. She then asked me to get her help which I did but she has just got a new boyfriend and she is not my daughter anymore. She smoking weed everyday and is not acting like my daughter at all. She ran away from home for 24 hours with no contact (she wasn't anywhere) she then returned cocky and nasty to all of her siblings and me. I suffer with depression and have a bad heart just like her and I really can't take much more of this. Sorry this is long but I really need to get it out there as I am lost. I just want my daughter back",Im so sorry you are both dealing with the repercussions of a horrific crime. The ongoing trauma from what happened is quite possibly a massive part of what is happening for your daughter that is contributing  to all those behavioural things.  You may be right that she has those diagnosis too. But those behaviours can be totally trauma results.,It sounds like she needs counselling so sorry about what happened to her. She's clearly having a very rough time and doesn't have the chance to process and work through her feelings properly.
"Hope this is okay to post, i need to vent. Doing okay, hanging in there. I wish I had the confidence to say no to people. Everyone always has to come to me to run errands for them, ask me to find something lost, or go out of my way- when I'm already occupied. It's hard when you have clinical depression, and exposed to trauma and emotional/verbal abuse.","Hey üëã I hope you are ok üëç I was the same my whole life since a teen looked for outside validation from others. Experienced anxiety and depression  and wasn‚Äôt able to manage it affectively. I began a healing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π journey. Began to love myslef and no longer needed outside valadation. I rewired my brain and I‚Äôm so positive now. I want u to know it is possible to come out the dark and not only into the light but to be happy. I‚Äôm so positive and happy now.

This is not the case, and it is a really tricky case to overcome, sometimes, not always you have to say NO ""I come first"". If you can help yourself,  then you can evaluate how you can help others.
If you are not right in yourself how can you justify a good resolution for others?"
"Can anyone understand how i am feeling , i want to be away from others, i live with my family , responsible for everything‚Ä¶but i want alone time ‚Ä¶. I am  wanting to escape everything and have some respite ‚Ä¶ not a holiday, a break from all i have been doing. During this time i have been struggling. 
No responsibilities, nothing, just focus on me , get myself well ‚Ä¶ 

Any suggestions welcome ‚Ä¶","All you can do is stay somewhere quiet or a Friends that could give you peace, or tell the folk you live with how you feel","It sounds like you're going through a tough time and feeling overwhelmed with responsibilities. It's completely understandable to want some alone time and a break from everything.

Here are a few suggestions that may help:

Communicate with your family: Let them know how you're feeling and that you need some alone time. Ask if they can help take over some responsibilities for a short period of time to give you a break.

Find a quiet space: If you don't have a room to yourself, try to find a quiet space where you can be alone with your thoughts. This could be a park, a library, or even just a quiet corner of your home.

Take care of yourself: Use this time to focus on self-care. Take a warm bath, read a book, practice meditation or yoga, or just do something that you enjoy.

Seek professional help: If you're struggling with your mental health, it may be helpful to seek professional help. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and take breaks when you need them."
"I've been told that I am overwhelming because of texting too much, I think they are right. I feel awful about it, not offended though. I think it stems from not having any siblings, both my parents are deceased, all my children are adults and do not have time for me, I have no communication with my grandchildren, not by my choice, I have no friends, only my dog and 2 cats and my plants. So, I become a hermit and withdraw back into isolation. I have chronic illnesses and pain with mental health illnesses that make it difficult to socialize. Then there are those who just do not believe me when I tell them I do not feel well,  others ignore me, some tell me the ""all you got to do's."" I look at my phone and there's no one to talk to. My phone never rings, only if it is medical or something other. I keep telling myself it will get better,  but its really not getting better. It's been like this for 54 years. I have no spouse and I know no one will marry me due to all these health issues and if they do ill just be a burden because I need a lot of care and help. I feel like my life is wasting away and I'm just waiting for my last day here. I find that my only Hope is God. I read the Bible everyday and watch good sermons and teachings in YouTube because I do not have a local church to go to and if I did have one,  I do not feel well enough to go. I keep telling myself that I refuse to feel sorry for myself and will not look for pity from others. I just want to share some of my struggles with you. Perhaps I can be useful in encouraging others about no matter how hard it gets, no matter how terrible you feel,  I'm here to listen to you. You will never be overwhelming to me. I will never get tired of hearing you. What you share are not complaints to me. You matter to me.

Just went to my NP today and discussed it. I‚Äôve been holding it all in for months trying to be strong for my son. It felt good to tell someone that I‚Äôm not doing good.

How can you feel OK...then one little thing can make you feel sh#t all day !?? ..I'm in angry mode and it's awful ! üòñ,Mnn,"It's not that one little thing can make you feel crap. It's that your holding up an unrealistic image of ""what you want to be"" and ""how you want it to be"" and if it's not met, which nothing ever really is for everyone, then you are disappointed. Just think about this, look at the way your acting ? Because things aren't meeting you requirements or expectancies?  Do you believe that everyone's requirements and expectancies are met on demand? You need to do as people do, and learn how to work with life. I'm only telling you this so that you can learn to be at peace. This is the way life works for everyone, but people learn how to remain neutral until something comes along and makes them happy then they can be happy while it lasts. No one's happy ALL of the time. Happiness is an emotion that comes and goes. It's contentment is what your looking for and everyone has, not happiness. When your content there's no need to yearn for happiness and sadness is not a factor because being happy is not obsessed over. So just learn how to be content and searching for happiness won't be an obsession. You can start by staying out of your mind. This is not to say the mind won't produce thoughts and keep going , but the less attention you pay to it the more it looses it's power and that power goes back to you. How do I know? Because obviously I've been there. Look up ""mindfulness"" and start practicing today. Your future self will be thankful."

My suggestion would be first and foremost keep yourself safe. You cannot help your son if you're injured or hurt. So, you are a priority.
Secondly, if he has a treatment provider, or team contact them.
If not, start with a crisis line. They will be able to recommend a course of action for you.
Outside of all of this, if you think your son is at risk of harming himself or others, call an ambulance and or the police.
You can also let your son know that you can visually see that he's going through a really tough time. Ask him if there's anything he wants you to do to help. Be transparent, and use sensible boundaries, and let him know what help or support you're able to provide. 
Thoughts are with you. Sending hugs because I'm sure you could use one right now. ü§óü§ó"

"Saw numerous doctors, still nothing. Any advice here?

Hey guys and gals, I‚Äôm posting here as a last resort. This will be long. A few years ago, I started having short stabbing headaches. They occur in various places and typically last only a few minutes at a time. When they happen however, they really mess me up. It gives me brain fog, makes it hard to put words to together and focus, honestly feel like someone has a nerve tied up with a bread tie in my noggin‚Äô. I already suffer from anxiety and panic attacks so I felt like this was something else to add to it. They would happen randomly, at odd times with no immediate trigger.

I saw my doctor about it who initially showed concern and recommended I monitor it and if it got worse or continued, we‚Äôd get me setup with a neurologist. In the meantime, I was recovering from thyroid cancer with a partial thyroidectomy. A few months later I checked back in with my endo and he told me that my prolactin was high and my levels were off so he was concerned I had a prolactinoma. I went in for an MRI with contrast to focus on the pituitary and it came back as normal and nothing weird. So he recommended that I start taking a med to reduce the prolactin level, rather than correct the abnormal thyroid function. 

Fast forward to this year. January I started taking B6 to reduce the prolactin levels in my blood and I‚Äôve yet to get updated blood work done with him. In july the headaches continued and my general doctor got me in with a neurologist who did a full brain MRI and they did a full work up of my brain. Results came back 100% clear. Normal brain, nothing weird anywhere. 

I just saw my doctor 3 weeks ago for an annual physical and the only abnormal levels were vitamin d. But I am recently vegetarian so it was expected. During all this I‚Äôve been noticing that I will randomly get dizzy or light headed. I woke up the other morning and my right ear was ringing and had a full feeling. I will note that my allergies have been absolutely fucking insane this year. To add to all this I will occasionally get the sensation that my head, at least the back of it is in after. You know the feeling when you‚Äôre floating on the top of a pool with part of your body submerged? That. And it‚Äôs freaking me out. 

I‚Äôve setup an appointment with an Ent late December but I am going mad. Multiple neuro visits, blood work, heart doctors even all telling me that my tests are showing absolutely nothing wrong with me. But these are real things that are happening to me. 

I‚Äôm not asking for medical advice, because I‚Äôve saw at least 5-10 doctors. Literally at this moment my head is doing this thing, I‚Äôm light headed, hard to get a breath, brain fog, etc. my blood pressure is literally 120/80

Please help","I have recently been diagnosed with a mental health condition. I spent 2 weeks in hospital as they first suspected a stroke, had MRI & CT scans & CT Scan with contrasts, all clear. I am light sensitive to bright lights. I physically collapsed 2 weeks ago, had vertigo & right sided weakness, a few days later all my limbs went weak. My arms are now back to full strength although I do shake at times when I am anxious. My legs are still weak & have to walk with an aid. Never realised mental health can affect your physical health.

I lost 25kg since 2017. I was not happy how I looked and felt. 
At first, I started eating clean Monday to Friday and gave myself treats at the weekend. Also, Started walking at least an hour a day. 
Whan I could see some progress I transitioned to ""Sunday funday"" and kept clean Monday to Saturday. ( Mentally it is easier to eat clean during the week knowing that I can treat myself on Sunday)
Also, I started running and going to the gym at least 4 days per week.
After 5 years I feel great and confident.

Children grieve as strongly as adults but it's even worse for them because it also raises so many existential thoughts and fears. Could this happen to mommy? To me? Talking about death, about his godfather, about his feelings is really important. Be honest but reassuring. Children know when adults lie and it makes them even more unsafe. Yes, we all can die but we'll do anything to be safe. Celebrate and make his godfather a presence and help him to connect to the love he gave him.  And above all give him tons of love, cuddles, patience and presence. He needs every single person that can be there for him. Be patient, he will go through it but it might be a rough ride. He might be angry, resentful and withdrawn. Healing takes time. If you have access to good grief counseling or grief groups for kids it's also very good.",Memory boxes are a wonderful way to remember and to share your thoughts and feelings about your loved one passing with each other as well as privately.

Fuk, I‚Äôd blow my fukin brains if I had a fukin piece 
Now I‚Äôm on my own yea  they all left
Cuz everything I owns in box to my left
The rich stay rich and the poor die young
To Fuk off all the pain I gota smoke up all my lungs
Got 3 kids,baby dads are bums
Both fuked off to hide behind their mums
I curse u motherfukas until the day I die
I‚Äôm gona fukin haunt ya right down from the fukin sky
Yous hurt my fukin heart now there‚Äôs a story to be told
The story bout Angie, her heart you could never hold 
Yea I kept ya kids alive yea I won this shit
Get called a slag for fukin wat
It‚Äôs my fukin wrists I wana fukin slit
Not a day I don‚Äôt think bout my mom
She dint grow me to be in this kinda slum
I was doin well before I met that prick
Run to the feds , Fuk I felt a snitch 
But to save my life I had to fukin switch
Yea as women we can see it thru
But wat da Fuk did I do to u??
So now I‚Äôm sitting here on my fukin own
Got one more kid that I gota grow
Couldn‚Äôt take my life if I wanted to
Gota see it thru for my little boo
Feel so blessed with my grandson 
Say ya fukin prayers can I have some!
Wear the fukin cross my momma gave me
Don‚Äôt know why but it‚Äôs brings tranquility 
Tranquility is all I need
Wana go swim in the deep blue seas
But them flights, they ain‚Äôt fukin free
Ain‚Äôt been nowhere in 20 yrs
But my fam , yea they fly yea here n there
Ain‚Äôt got a care, Naa they wasn‚Äôt there
Don‚Äôt give a Fuk if we starve to death
Sleep in m&s wen they go to bed
Fuk them frauds I‚Äôve fukin had enough 
They ain‚Äôt lived me I‚Äôve had it fukin tough
If I had a fukin gun 
I‚Äôd smoke them in a puff
So I‚Äôll rate me, cuz I‚Äôm a diamond in the rough

          XXXXXXXXXX","You need to find a way to stop the pattern of your brains signal to anything negative. What helps me is the 5 second rule. Every time you catch yourself having a negative thought or feeling an anxiety attack is coming on just take stop, take a deep breath, then count 5,4,3,2,1... then immediately think of something positive or something that makes you feel good even if you have to force yourself. Just keep doing this 100x a day if you have to. This interrupts the brains association to negativity that ultimately results in stress and anxiety. You are rewiring your brain. This technique has really helped me reduce all the negativity that circles in my head. Hope this helps. =)",Mindful meditation is wonderful and listening to ambient music can be very soothing

"Hi everyone,

I'm sorry to bother you, but lately I've been struggling with my schoolwork in college. In my first year, I was doing exceptionally well, getting As and passing all of my classes. 

But this year, I've been failing miserably in a lot of my classes. The thing is I'm trying to do some inner child work and working through childhood trauma. But it seems to be affecting my motivation and discipline. It's not the same as it was in first year. I went to see the college counsellor, but I left them because they We're incredibly invalidating.

Now I'm scared that I'll lose the privilege of going to college and I'll lose my scholarship.

But at the same time, I was also thinking of taking a leave of absence to prioritize my mental health. I've thought of the consequences, but I'm still wary.

Any thoughts?","Hello, I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your childhood trauma, I really am, but it depends how much you want this?

Today was a hard day for me sometimes I feel like I'm getting better but days like today it makes me wonder,Microdosing shrooms are very helpful and beneficial if used properly. I recommend you to contact Dr_Chris_naturals on Instagram for guidelines and good products.,My days go on and on sometimes I hit a wall a set back throws me off balance forgetting what I have accomplished from the hard work I have done for those years I was in so much in pain but I somehow I climb over that wall and remember how far I have come I may hit that wall again but I always come out learning more about myself
My mental heath is getting worse I feel so alone all the time worrying about my mental health getting out of control again,"Same, I seem to have had a relapse and gone backwards!","My dear Joey, permit me to address this issue from the root cause. You must first realize that you are a wonderful person that has the full right to be joyful. Secondly, you are allowing your body to dance to the tune of that your thought pattern is playing for you. Your present thoughts are as a result of circumstances and situations that have played out in your life before now, and apparently, those circumstances and situations were ugly, so the thoughts they formed in your subconsciousness are ugly. It is these unpalatable and depressive thoughts that your mind is presently dwelling on and causing you to feel this negativity you are presently feeling. 
My joy is that, I can authoritatively tell you that in that your same mind is domiciled the power that you require to turn the ugly condition around and create your joy! In your mind lies your solution!! Believe me, joy, happiness and peace are right there in your hands waiting eagerly for you to claim and possess them. Just try out these few steps to start with:
1. Loud Verbal Declaration: When you wake up every morning, stand in front of your mirror and declare audibly ""I AM A WONDERFUL CREATION OF GOD AND I AM CREATED TO BE JOYFUL, AND ENJOY PEACE FROM WITHIN. THERE IS NO SPACE FOR DEPRESSIVE THOUGHTS IN MY MIND""
""I SEND EVERY NEGATIVE ENERGY AND THOUGHTS OUT OF MY MIND NOW"" ""TODAY I SHALL BE HAPPY, JOYFUL AND FRUITFUL""
Declare this for about 2 or 3 times with a smile on your face.
2. Music: Search out the songs that bring you joy and affect your mood positively whenever you play them. You can play them and sing along. 
3, Deep Breathing exercises: As many times as possible during the day, do a deep breathing exercise by breathing in deeply and breathing out completely. 
4. Carefully select the kind of thoughts you allow into your imagination and mind and watch what you unknowingly or knowingly meditate on. Disallow every thought that have a negative coloration. For no reason must you let negative thoughts take root in your heart. Weed them out as soon as they come into you. 
Our thoughts are the seeds for our joy or sadness.
5. Make sure you make someone, at least one person happy (either by giving them something or helping them out even in the smallest way) Smile a lot at people when you greet them.
Enjoy peace and joy."
"TW : abortion and suicide LONG POST

I‚Äôm literally so sad I‚Äôm trying to not cry . I am a single mom . I signed up for this . I chose the wrong guy to sleep with and I stopped talking to him because he made me feel worthless . He only wanted the baby and me pay him child support while he takes care of the kid or I get an abortion .. sometimes I think I should have gotten one . I love my baby but I have several issues if my own . But without my kid I probably would have k.myself !! And I tried to do everything I was so miserable.. I tried talking to people , therapy , meds , hanging out with people . It was a really dark time for me and when I found out I was pregnant and kid came I felt like I needed to keep going .. but I don‚Äôt really have much help . My kid is 1 and has spent the night over someone house once . It‚Äôs always me and my kid . I don‚Äôt really have friends even though I try ..  I suffer from depression and anxiety still . I just dont know what to do . I‚Äôm starting to feel helpless again and I have thoughts of giving my kid up for adoption . But I love my kid and I don‚Äôt think I could live with myself so I‚Äôm pretty much stuck . And people makes you feel awful for being a single mom . I just can‚Äôt üòî","Awww. You definitely need support even if that's in the form of support groups. Yes it's hard to not have family and friends but what I've learned is that if those things are not available then find secondary sources that can help even if they are not as great as true family or true friends.         My suggestions are: Library-- there are usually free kids events that can just bring you and your little a sense of community. The librarians are usually always helpful and leading so that makes anxiety lessen. The more you go the more comfortable you'll be there.        In person support groups-- even though these people might never be your best friend, there is something about hearing others, interacting with others, and having a safe place to breathe. You are not alone and support groups help you really understand that.         County Community Services--- This I recommend not for the general mental health, but  ask to have a case worker. It's all free and they help with finding programs in your community for your specific case. They can help you with child care options so you can go to support groups, there are also in home parenting mentorships and also early preventative childhood programs where you take your child to play with other children.           I think you are a wonderful person to have chosen life and that little child you are responsible for is definitely blessed to have you. Many prayers and well wishes. I hope this gave you some hope to push forward and find support to pull you through.",My dear you are a beautiful wonderful person and a loving Mother. Your baby loves you and needs you. Get all the help you can. Doctor health visitor Mother and baby group. You will be surprised how many people will understand your feelings. You are brave and strong. You will overcome all this.

Your sexuality and gender orientation is yours and you are not obliged to share it or talk about it with everyone. Find people who can, and will support you and focus on being true to yourself.

I cannot do it for you but I promise you that there's alot out there waiting for you if only you would lower your guards and your walls and allow for yourself to see this and allow the light to come in.

I kinda feel lost. I was in a relationship for 6 years we've been split up a year. I new the relationship we had was tough and that I had gone through things I shouldn't of. But after talking to a therapist, she's now pointing out that it was domestic abuse. I guess because he never hit me I didn't see it like that.

My mum cares for me as best as she can but she‚Äôs emotionally unavailable and very self centred / borderline narcissistic . I‚Äôm dealing with depression all on my own with a few distant friends. I have come to realise that I may also be a bit of a narcissist and struggle in conversation about mundane things. I‚Äôm leaning on my faith to give me strength and guidance which is Islam. Has anyone else seen narcissistic traits in themselves and overcome it. How do you change your lack of attention to / interest in others. It‚Äôs lonely having little interest in things and being so self-cantered.,You start by being mindful of your actions. Search for videos of Dr. Ramani on youtube. She's the expert on narcissism. I'm sure you'll find the answers you need.,"Not being able to focus on conversations can also be a symptom of other things like anxiety or ADHD etc. I wrote a book about anxiety.

"Hello! Posting for a friend who is not on Facebook. My brothers friend has issues with restlessness, high anxiety, agitation and sometimes sudden bursts of agression. Once the burst is over he falls in a ‚Äúvacuum‚Äù of down emotions. Also, he, sometimes has unexpected feeling of sadness. He can be sitting down and talking to someone and then suddenly he experiences a deep feeling of sadness, for no reason. Then he jumps back to normal. He says it‚Äôs like the bursts overtake him and they are extremely difficult to manage. Now he went into therapy. He really wants to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this and manage. If possible. He recently read that irritation, sudden mood changes can be also caused by a thyroid gland and/or can be related to kidneys as well? Is that possible? If so, what can he check?

"I'm looking for some advice for UK. I have suffered lot of abuse from my wife and have been blackmailed which is getting worse.

If she wants anything done or gets angry on anything then she will ask for divorce and tell me she will take kids away which are all under age of 10. I'm very attached to kids and she knows it's my weakness and I continue to obey her for sake of my kids who will be destroyed.

If I argue,c stand up then she will simply say give me divorce and I'm going to destroy all you have so I get scared.

It does not matter how much I make her happy or do for her, if I don't or can't do something she wants then she will threaten me, stop being normal and will demand divorce every time.

I have a house on mortgage which I pay, my name and have some good savings.

Is there any way I can protect the house such as putting it in trust on my kids name so in event of divorce it stays with kids?

Is there any way I can protect my savings such as deposit in another country where UK has no rights to access that money?

Can she take kids out of UK and settle back home without my permission? She is very greedy and her family are happy for her to leave me and get all money and move back so they can all take advantage of me. I can't see my kids settling out of UK in third world country and it hurts me to even think about this.

Thank you.",A lot of people think only woman suffer I lot of men are out there quietly suffering in silence well done for speaking out I hope you get some help ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,Omg i feel for you some people dont deserve kids. You sound a good man go seek a good solicitor fight for whats yours xxx

I don't know if it was a panic or anxiety attack or if I'm having some sort of mental breakdown.

I am super stressed and in a situation that I don't know how to fix or what to do, it's literally driving me insane. 

I couldn't stop crying and couldn't breathe, I got pins and needles in my ears, hands and feet, I couldn't see straight, felt sick, dizzy and cold and was hyperventilating through crying. Then my fingers froze completely, I couldn't even use or hold my phone, had to lie on the floor. 

Whole episode lasted about 40 minutes and it was so scary

I've never had one and anything like this before.

I decided to get a dog and that was a bad idea cus all the mental abuse I grew up with and my marriage.

I want a dog again but I don‚Äôt know mental if im ready if that makes sense,Well done on being in a good relationship. A dog is for life quite long time so I would think carefully about it.

"And so my time wasting in life, just goes on. I seem to spend so much time on social media. That it's just addictive. So much so, that I've allowed it to disrupt my body clock. I get so engrossed with chatting on Facebook messenger, that it's dominating my life. So, when nobody responses to me. I just sulk like a immature spoilt inner child that I'm still dealing with. I spend all my time being alone. That can cause the occasional low feeling of being isolated. I am trying to arrange on Facebook friend and dating groups to meet up with someone. But that's not going well. I come a few who say that they wanna meet up. But they just don't seem to be all that keen to do so. 

Realistically, I know I need to join social groups. But I have social anxiety and I find it hard to approach people and strike up a conversation with them. I need to make a effort to attend these sort of social groups. But I'm lazy and I can't be bothered to plan something. Ugh, I'm so bored at the moment. I wish I could change the way I live my boring life. Being sleep deprived doesn't exactly help as it effects my energy levels and all I do is spend the majority of time. Is sitting on fat lazy backside and navigating around on my phone. I'm so addicted to it. What a waste of a life, I live. Sorry, I'm cynical but I am just so clueless on how to live a fulfilled proactive life. 

Wishing all of you. Good mental health.","Start small.  U need to do activities that make you feel good.  Don't think about relationships self care and getting out the house r main things. You can't meet people stuck in your house. You can succeed. You can have a happy life. You can find someone you like. You r in charge of your life David. You have to find your inner strength and say I am going to be happy

I want to do better and be better and stop giving in to my emotions.

Thank you for letting me post on here. At the beginning of February I broke my foot and the isolation that it caused has had a devastating effect on my mental health. My 23 year old son lives with me but works full time . He was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder in 2017 because of his father's actions . So because of this he and I are very close. This can cause an almost clingy attachment. . He is my only living family. Almost  4  weeks ago on Sunday we had a massive falling out and he left.  I have no idea where he is and he's refusing to speak to me .Despite me trying every avenue.  This is killing me. I've got the most horrendous anxiety and contacted my GP twice but won't give me anything.  I'm not sleeping and when I do I'm waking up drenched in sweat and shaking. I don't really have any close friends as I don't come from the area.  I'm beyond hurt but I'm heartbroken that others know where he is but I don't.  The anxiety is overwhelming and I've seriously considered ending it all twice this week but stopped myself.  Thank you for listening,I‚Äôm sure he will return,"Poor you, hang in there as things will get better. Your son I am sure will come back to you maybe not today but sometime as a son needs his mum no matter what.

One worker may have 20 ‚Äòservice users‚Äô hence, the ‚Äòservice user‚Äô who needs help will get a once a month appointment - The only advice I can give is you have to grab your own recovery & find some mental health fellowships not dissimilar to AA or NA - The idea of one mental health sufferer with SOME RECOVERY helping another who isn‚Äôt so far down the line, is without parallel-because they have experience of wearing the same t-shirt as you - unlike LITTLE JOHNNY & SUSIE - We have to get real with ourselves & get honest - With that you can go a fair way üëç Good Luck",Prayers Amy for Jeff and you!

Even at it's finest Life does not seem like such a great deal even when everything is going great it still seems to be a burden.

Sometimes you cannot even do this no matter how many plans and adjustments you make in your life to take out all the negative stuff there is always a third party to affect your vibes usually in the negative way. Very few people interacting your life in a positive way sometimes this is hard to admit to and see.

Having him around so close yet feel like he is the other side of the planet,   it hurts.  Currently curled up in one of his jumpers i stole from my younger sister,  wishing we had any chance of any kind of relationship.  i hate how he makes me feel.  Yet he doesn't even know it.","Disappointed love is devastating,  but try to remember he's the one that's not capable of having a relationship, evolving, or making any effort to move forward. Being the better person is hard, but worth knowing you tried your best regardless. 
My dad used to say we were all a mistake and he never wanted kids but he had 6 kids... eventually I stopped having any expectations of him as a father and was free of the disappointment. 
When I became a parent I made the effort to develop a sort of friendship with him, mostly for my daughter to have a sense of family. I found that I could appreciate him far more when I had no emotional expectations of him as my father but just accepted him as the person he was... before he passed away he thanked me for making the effort and letting him into mine and my daughters life. 
Letting go of expectations isn't easy at first but worth ridding yourself of the torment of years of disappointment.",Really sorry to hear that.  My dad was very bad man. Never really had a dad

"wonder if anyone could give me any advice...my mum has had mental health problems for along as I can remember....as a teenager she used to walk around the house with scissors and knives in her back pocket 
The police have been called on multiple occasions for disturbses her walking around the streets on her nightie
My dad drank and it always got brushed under the carpet and ignored.
Sadly 5 years ago we lost my dad and i look after my mum 
Cutting the story short the last 5 years she's been attacking me throwing plates cups and other things at me she talks to herself saying very disturbing things 
Monday she came at me with a knife and sliced my hand.i know I should of called the police right away but I just ran
Since then I have reported this to the police but told me unless I press charhed against her they can't do alot and told me to go down the mental health route 
I have contacted the mental health crisis team they have told me they will try contact her via phone call   social services won't do anything 
O have contacted her gp and they won't talk to me without her authorisation 
Is their any other way I can get her help? I can't keep getting verbally and physically abused putting myself or my children's life in danger","I think your priority has to be ensuring you and your children are safe. You can not be putting yourself, and your children in potential danger. 
I know that will be hard, but it‚Äôs vital.
You do need to call 999 if you, your family or she is putting herself in danger. 
Can you keep contact and support via phone, video calls etc? 
I take it from the way you have written this that she doesn‚Äôt want to seek help for herself? It‚Äôs really hard if she doesn‚Äôt want to get any help or recognise that she requires it. 
What does she say when you talk to her about getting help?
Is she willing to call the doctor while you are there for example?",Ring 999 and keep ringing them until they do something.
"When people would rather avoid you that tells me the world doesn‚Äôt want me , I have no skills, I can‚Äôt do anything and I have no friends . I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm alive just now.","How long have you been feeling like this?  Make an appointment with your GP to help. They are great listeners.  Is there something deeper troubling you?  
What are your interests?   
Skills I can see right here.  Your great at writing including spelling etc.",Rob no matter what we all say you will feel the same . My advice is to remember you are a person that has lots to give . Don't ever give up and show the world who Robert Turner is

"I can't take this anymore, no one understands and just expects me to be normal, have a normal life and have the future that was planed but I'm really unwell but it's not acknowledged cos it doesn't show and so I get pressured to be just who I was before my health problems started.

They can't see cos my autism doesn't allow me to show the horrible pain I'm in everyday, they can't see my vision loss, they can't see my restricted movement, they can't see the persistent tiredness that turns to exhaustion so bad anytime I do something I have to sit or lay down for an hour to get enough strength back to do something else, they can't see any of it so don't believe it's as bad as I say.

Doctors can't find what's causing all this so it's not seen as it no one can explain the cause and cos it's not seen or explained due to a diagnosis that litrally means we don't know what causes these symptoms  I get no help or support just pressure to be normal like I was, despite just getting dressed exhausts me meaning i have to sit down to recover, muscle weakness and pain that makes picking up or carrying anything feel like my arms are being torn off along with horrible intestinal  problems causing me horrible pain and now it turns out malabsorption as I'm not absorbing vitamins and minerals from my food and food supliments aswell as many other health issues none which the doctors can explain or understand the cause of.

So I am not seen not understood, not helped, not supported just pressured to be healthy and normal, get a job and keep it despite my physical health and autism meaning I always get forced out as I'm unable to do the job so I get laid off on health grounds within 3 months of starting and without a job all my plans for me and my wife's future are ruined yet she can't see any of this either and also just pressures me to build the future I promised before I got sick but I don't know how, everything is ruins. 

Ruins I am let sat in alone unseen, not understood not helped not supported and I can't take anymore I just want to go!

Please note I'm too much of a coward too scared of more pain and don't have the physical ability to do anything all I can do is vent.","Venting is a good a source of relief and there‚Äôs so many people on here in your shoes. 
Your not alone.

Cause not gonna lie nothing makes me more mad when people tell me what to do

It's either have positive conversations that you can do something about or it's just a vicious negative cycle and explain you aren't in a place where you  an be in that cycle. Make a good life choice about the things going on or don't talk about them. We all need a good rant but it has to call a day eventually and have other conversations of much more worth.

Morning all. Just a small question as such. My girlfriend of 3 years has decided my mental health issues are my fault and it's why our relationship will discontinue.

Spiritual health is so important to your mental health It's important to Find your Own balance between the Scientific side of things and the side with all the meaning..the spiritual side .,More importantly it's balancing in knowing who you can talk too on spiritual levels and most people you can't maybe why your own space is important it's your feild of creation,Science tells me I will be on dialysis in two years the spiritual part tells me my kidneys will get better and the rest of my health will get better ÔøºGod already cured of high blood pressure I no longer take heart medication thank you Jesus

I couldn't say the last time he gave a bath, changed a diaper, and has never put them to bed or lose a minute of sleep over them even as a newborn.

"Hi, i'm new here and just want to tell a little about myself. I've suffered on and off for 10 years with depression it started as post natal depression after my son was born. I am 50 years old and a mother of 2 autistic boys aged 14 & 10. Life is hard enough with them but my mom passed away 2 years ago. She was my best friend and i spiraled again into a depression. I was in an unhappy marriage so decided last year to get out of it. I feel sometimes like i am being swallowed up and just want to cry all the time and other times i feel on top of the world. Today is a bad day. ü•∫
Thankyou for listening.","Hang in there things will get better. Take one day at a time. Good luck, thinking of you ‚ù§","Sending you love and strength  üíï take each day as it comes. You will get to have more and more good days. Depression is a battle, but you will win. You need to make time to concentrate on you and your needs, every mum needs that.  Xx"
"If you are employed I'm just wondering how people mentally cope with working? If someone gives me the slightest bit of ""constructive criticism"" I can't cope. It makes me doubt everything it make me even doubt I should be allowed to be alive. Any tips? üò≠",I also have issues maintaining employment. The last few years I done remote jobs (work from home) which does help but I've also recently filed for disability to see if I'll be approved because then I can work part-time which will also help. It is a struggle but I have to make a living one way or the other.,Shame is probably the most devastating emotion to cope with but it can be healed. Avoidance will help short term but can do much more harm than good. Healing shame comes through finding a sense of worth for who you are and not what you do. It's a tough issue to solve but I would guess it's been a long struggle and in many areas. There is help and even if it's a  tough process your life will improve in ways you cannot imagine.

Feeling worried and anxious üò•,"Ayse Acar  Thanks for reaching out and sharing. Panic attacks are the worst and everybody deals with it differently.

Had trauma assessment I've come from primary mental health to community mental health what's the difference,"I believe that trauma is basically something done in hospital, like assessments or stays in a mental health ward, community is as it suggest you'll now be seen by the community mental health team, who support people back in the community,  so the community mental health team have mental health nurses, a psychiatrist etc. So it should be a local CMH team to your area.","So sorry for how you feel mate ‚ù§Ô∏è.... l will suggest you reach out to (prime_tyms) on Instagram, He's a good mycologist, just tell him what you might be going through such as BPD, ADHD, PTSD anxiety, depression or panic attack and wait for his recommendations and guidelines. His prescriptions has been amazing. I recently purchased Golden teacher mushrooms for my mental health üòäüíô"
I went to the doctors this morning and begged 4 help. The emergency mental health contacted me and basically said to just go and speak to therapists. I have one already. I start new meds tomorrow and I am petrified that nobody is really listening to me. I asked to be sectioned but they wont do it. Because I can verbally tell them that I am not well I go to the bottom of the queue. Unless I physically harm someone or myself nothing can be done and it is just crazy.,Im listening üòä,"So sorry for your experience, just DM me now I would like glad to listen and not judge you"
Lost my dad today. I looked after him for 7 years he had dementia. It's hard knowing that parents are not here anymore üò¢,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't even begin to imagine that level of grief. I'm sure he would be very proud of you and wouldn't want you to suffer. Please remember he is always with you.... You are him and he is you. He left you as his future and wants you to shine bright.

Grief comes in waves. You will get through it. Some times will be easier than others. But essentially... You will do him proud my love and I'm sure that's all he ever wanted. You have stepped into a new timeline. One where you have to be the strength you saw in him.

Sending lots of love your way. Xx",So sorry for your loss

Chin up,"So sorry for your loss üòî this is such a hard time even without regrets, the same happened to me in 2022 when my dad died, many regrets and sadness things couldn't have been different due to my problems and where I was headwise up until his death, we can grow through these things, it's the time to love yourself and go gently with yourself here, similar situation as you I didn't have anyone during that time, I managed to get myself on the list for counselling which I started a year later and things have improved, try find yourself some support if you can whatever that may look like, I found it helpful to read online some grieving literature and I found some herbs that support during grieving.. ‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô•"
"I had a really goodish day yesterday but the crippling anxiety is back with a vengeance.  I had spoken to a GP on Friday who was not someone I'd spoken to or had dealings with. Couldn't understand what he was saying for most of the call Gave me crisis numbers for over the weekend and said he'd call me today. He did and again I really struggled to understand him. Asking how I was and I told him ,I wasn't sleeping or eating andvmy heart rate was 97/106 There were just long silences. I've now spoken to him abd another Gp two weeks ago and they won't prescribe me anything to take the edge of this. I did stupidity say I just wanted this to end and maybe that's why. I have fibromyalgia which I take really strong  controlled drugs for ,so if I was suicidal some diazepam weren't going to be the tablet of choice 
Still crippled with overwhelming anxiety and no further forward . When I put the request in on Friday I asked for a specific GP who I've dealt with before, who's had mental health issues in the past so is empathetic and knows me",when I first lost my sight I was in a really bad way the doctors prescribed me medication but every tablet which I took made me very suicidal so Blind Veterans UK got involved and it took them two years to get me sorted out and now here I am 10 years later and a far better person mentally,So sorry you are suffering Emma. Message me if I can help xx
Wife wants to separate and now she says things not fixable I'm so lost and alone no friends just my kids no body talk to nobody to lesson I love this girl more than anything I don't want to push her away any further I at least want to keep her friendship she's that important in my life and kids,Sometimes in marriage we grow in different directions and that‚Äôs ok.  What‚Äôs important is for you both to be there for kids during this difficult transition.  Look into a support group for those going through a divorce.  It will help talking with others going through the same.,So sorry. Can u take a vactaion maybe a solo vacation so u can come up with a plan and decompress?

Ôøº Can anyone relate?Ôøº,I can,So what now? I have been getting the runaround from my insurance for last week and a half trying to find help.
I'm really pissed off right now it's unreal I've not long got bk from the police station here's why so this morning i go into town and go to Iceland where i get milk and a ready meal i pay for it all and leave as I'm walking home i notice that someone is following me it was my 2nd ex gf and her son the woman who treated me like shit when I was with her for almost 10 years as I'm about to turn the corner to go to mine I'm knocked to the ground and kicked by those 2 people thankfully there was a person near by and came over and got those people off me the woman called the police on those people ( if you can call them that ) unfortunately the 2 people run off ( gd thing i know who they are and where they live.) 5 minutes later the police turn up thankfully i knew one of the officers the woman explained to the officers what happened i was better than bruised cuts on my face and in a lot of pain from my right shoulder the one with arthritis the woman came with me to the police station she did a statement then was allowed to go i thanked her for her help my friend helped clean me up and looked at my shoulder which was badly bruised she took a photo of my shoulder and my face and head i told my police friend where they live and there names her partner left to go to the address while my friend stayed with me then at 6.15am i was allowed to go home my friend said that she will make sure that they get punished for what they did i was also told that I don't have to go to court because of my mental health plus they have photos of my injuries.,"I had similar experience with my husband even with all the signs i confronted him but he lied about the affair, someone actually talked to me about eric_cyberhacker who could link his phone remotely direct to mine without him knowing or touching his phone before I was able to get evidence from his chat and text messages even deleted conversations directly to my phone. I strongly recommend if you need such help on Facebook Eric Cyberhacker",So you know who was following you. I was about to ask. Why were you being followed? Do you know? Why did they hurt you?
How are you lovely people coping today?,"Not bad thanks, hope your'e well ‚ò∫","So, all my good intentions of the first few weeks have gone to pot over the last two, frustrated and annoyed with myselfüò°"
"Hi everyone I'm really interested in what keeps you motivated? What gets you through the day, week, month etc need some inspiration!",Prayer depending on my moon cleaning my house  going to church being with my friends if I get anxiety I color it keeps me focus walk the dog watching my favorite tv shows  I try to keep busy doing all these things makes me feel like I have accomplished something and then I feel good about myself,Sobriety has helped immensely! Eating well and exercise plays a role as well‚Ä¶ setting small goals so I don‚Äôt overwhelm myself‚Ä¶ each person is different. I do hope you find what works best for yourself! You got this. üôÇ
How to overcome social anxiety?,Don't go out,Socialise with small groups and likeminded people
"I‚Äôm not being racist or anything I am black my self. I feel like black guys always put me down and do me the worst . Literally wether we friends , dating or i just know them .. they talk to me real bad and make me feel worthless. And I never know what to say or how to stick up for myself . I hate that it is my own race and sometimes even my own blood . I‚Äôm so tired of it . I start to hate my self for allowing such awful things to be said and done to me . It‚Äôs almost like I can‚Äôt escape it üò≠üò≠üò≠ I need prayers",I tend to see they come up with the worst immature insults.,Some of them feel bad about themselves and/or women in their family.
"I should stop thinking but I just reflected on this 

I just noticed my mom is very jealous whenever I socialize 

Many times in public she would glare at me whenever I talked to people in public 

I have two times I can deeply remember 

1. I was about to enter Starbucks and this lady got her shoulder bag  stuck on a chair and I commented ‚Äúoh no‚Ä¶ I hate when that happens‚Äù ( cause I also own one and I know the feeling) 
And I swear my mom‚Äôs eyes went wide and she gave me the meanest look as like ‚Äúwhy would you do that? 

2: at Costco, so okay I love wearing alternative fashion with stand out colors dunno if you guys know Decora kei fashion but I followed that I still do not as much so yeah I was wearing my hair in pigtails and cute clothing and someone went ‚Äúnice outfit‚Äù and I replied thanks and mom did the same thing 

And now with online whenever she would see me getting along with people instead of her being proud she‚Äôd give me a look 

Like‚Ä¶ 

You want me for yourself only? 

That‚Äôs so unhealthy",Okay maybe Mom is trying to protect you. You seem a very open and trusting person and Mum knows the world isn't very trusting. She probably cares a bit too much and is scared watching you grow up. Idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,Some people don't like people doing random talking. its strange its ok if the person you speak to was ok with it. but the person you was with was not its a bit of a wierd one . I get this problem i think it must happen to everybody
"I feel like I'm going to die soon. I'm not feeling well at all. I lived with chronic illnesses and chronic pain with mental health illnesses for so many years. The doctors have ignored me and I lived without meds because they refuse to help me. I've searched for years for  good doctors  but with no avail I have yet not found any. I'm not looking for pity, just support. All I do is lay in bed. I am exhausted all the time and in pain. I do not think I can give all the details of what's wrong with me right now, but if you want to know anything feel free to ask. I'm just making peace with the Lord and preparing myself. I told my family but they refuse to accept it. I've been making arrangements. I just feel sad for my children that I may have to leave them so soon. I have to trust the Lord to take care of them. I didn't get to see my youngest sons very married yet or to spend time with my grandchildren. My dog Leo will be 11 years old in January.  He's an old little guy and blind. I was hoping he goes before me because he's been with me 24hours a day for 11 years. He is my emotional support. He will feel very sad if I go first. I just want to thank all of you that took the time to read this. Your friendship means a lot to me. I may not have known you personally, but I've been praying for you. Remember that I love you and I hope and pray that the Lord will help each one of you and your families and friends. God bless you. ‚ù§Ô∏è","Tell me more about Leo, I am a ""dog"" person also, and in my 70's. A pet is more than an animal to me. They are family, sometimes, well most of the time, they are all you have to talk to, (here), we talk to the Lord also, but we don't physically see him yet.ü§ó","Something similar happened to me years back. I was in tremendous pain, I could not get out of the bed. I remember having to go to work, crying in the bus and whatnot. I went to different doctors, all of them dismissed me. My husband called emergency services and their response was - she is spoiled, give her tea. A day after that night, when he called emergency services I collapsed in the bus on the way home. It turned out I had internal bleeding. They had to revive me a couple of times, because they kept losing me, but in the end, thanks to God and the doctor who didn't want to let me go, to put it that way, I survived. I feel your pain, but please hold on. Don't think about dying - you have wonderful children and they need their mother. Trust me. They need you. Regardless of their age, they will always need you. I have kids, so I know. Please, just hold on. And if you ever need to talk to someone, we are all here ü´∂"
Do you ever feel like your life is like wet sand and everyday your sinking further down and your never going to get out that‚Äôs how I feel I just don‚Äôt want to be like this anymore I just want to get out of the sand,"Yes, I've felt like this too many times to count. I like your analogy.üíó I used to describe it as just needing the world to stop spinning for a moment so I could catch up.
The one thing I know about wet sand or even quicksand...it's usually a case of someone else pulling you to safety.
I wonder if this feeling might be telling you it's time to ask for help? Or even time to trust others to take over or get you out of a tought situation?","Sometimes it feels Asif you're balanced on a very slippery, tiny rock under that quick sand, and one small push is all it needs to go down"
"My personal and professional life both suck ! I don‚Äôt know what to do , people who listened are tired of listening .. I feel completely up against the wall ! Sometimes I can‚Äôt breath out of anxiety , I cry my self to sleep most nights.. Anyone else feel the same ?",You want to talk about it,"Sometimes mate, but a true friend will listen,and support you no matter what. Always around if you need chat, and its never a problem xx"
,Need friendships to support me,Sometimes that‚Äôs a harder question to answer than you would think. 
"Wish there was euthanasia for people like me in my country. I would choose on it in a heart beat. Then I would float on the sea of non-existence, forever. No more sleepless nights and overthinking. 

So I have Borderline intellectual disability, which means that i suck at everything and i can't interact with others well. I am in the depths of hell and i always have been, i can't imagine what a normal life feels like, even if i forced myself. My friend count is zero, because i can't have meaningful conversations or imagine how other people feel like, so i could be somewhat relatable. That's roughly my story.","I hope this message can help as that helped me too, After I have experienced many bad things in life i‚Äôve found faith in Jesus. I would say no matter the situation we are in, my advice is let‚Äôs try to give all pains and ask forgiveness to Him with our hearts today. We can‚Äôt understand yet everything in life but things can change in faith! Remember the suffering we have here is temporary and our life can change trough Him! Seek help in Jesus",Sometimes the burden is too great for other people to be listening. Keep conversation to things of common interest like music movies hobbies holidays and so on. I would never try to persuade anyone on religion. There are many different spiritual paths. Yoga for example. Some people do experience spiritual healing for physical and mental problems. Some things you can only experience for yourself not by what others say.
"My husband was diagnosed with bipolar and manic and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Some of the items he bought were 2 motorcycles and a car.  He ended up signing the titles over to a friend who now refuses to give his property back.  Since these were purchased while being manic before he got a diagnosis, any experience with this? This person won‚Äôt return any of my calls or texts.  She is also a social worker and took advantage of my husband‚Äôs money when he thought he was a millionaire and was giving it away to everyone.",That's awful shame on her.

It's important to remember that everything is curable and that includes your current situation. While Tardive Dyskinesia can be a difficult condition to manage, there are treatments available that can help alleviate the symptoms.
These may include herbal remedies, such as valerian root or passionflower, which are believed to have calming effects on the nervous system. Acupuncture and acupressure techniques may also be considered, as they aim to restore the body's energy balance.
 As for your depression, it's crucial to seek professional help and explore various options to find a suitable treatment plan. Remember, with a growth mindset, you have the ability to overcome obstacles and find solutions that work for you.

"When I think that I'm ""in trouble"" either at work or with my partner I find it hard to look the person I'm talking to (the accuser) in the eye. Could this potentially be an autistic trait?  Sorry I know autism isn't a mental illness but don't know where else to ask.","Please note: that Autism is a genetic condition NOT a mental health issue.
HOWEVER it can affect peoples mental health.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. Some people with ASD have a known difference, such as a genetic condition. Other causes are not yet known. Scientists believe there are multiple causes of ASD that act together to change the most common ways people develop. We still have much to learn about these causes and how they impact people with ASD.

People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. There is often nothing about how they look that sets them apart from other people.  The abilities of people with ASD can vary significantly. For example, some people with ASD may have advanced conversation skills whereas others may be nonverbal. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others can work and live with little to no support.

ASD begins before the age of 3 years and can last throughout a person‚Äôs life, although symptoms may improve over time. Some children show ASD symptoms within the first 12 months of life. In others, symptoms may not show up until 24 months of age or later. Some children with ASD gain new skills and meet developmental milestones until around 18 to 24 months of age, and then they stop gaining new skills or lose the skills they once had.

As children with ASD become adolescents and young adults, they may have difficulties developing and maintaining friendships, communicating with peers and adults, or understanding what behaviors are expected in school or on the job. They may come to the attention of healthcare providers because they also have conditions such as anxiety, depression, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which occur more often in people with ASD than in people without ASD.",Sorry if I've annoyed or upset anyone with my question. It is a genuine question and no malice was intended. I'm going through a really bad time at present personally and professionly and I am questioning every single detail about myself.
I lost my partner two years ago and it‚Äôs our wedding anniversary tomorrow is it still an anniversary do I say would have been or we have been married for that amount of time I‚Äôm thinking about it we talked about getting old together and now we are not and I‚Äôm here on my own with my child struggling with no family or friends and it‚Äôs hard sorry for rambling I have no one else to talk to this group helps x,I'm here also,"Sorry love.
U can chat with me."
"Im interested in mental health. I try to be a listener as well as read. My own mental health is variable however. I‚Äôve tried about thirty times to contact my support worker. Every time she is out of the office or off sick or not answering her phone. I can‚Äôt go to the office without an appointment. I just want to know if I have a care plan and what it is. I‚Äôm under the team. My consultant and support worker agreed I‚Äôd be seen weekly. I have had one appt with my support worker in late January. At the mh team. 

Even if I can‚Äôt get a worker to visit me myself I‚Äôm passionate about doing all I can myself in life for me for the world and above all for mental health issues. 

I just want to find out what my care plan or purpose is but it‚Äôs hard to contact the team to find out. More urgently still I want to find ways of doing anything at all that can help generally. I‚Äôm a puzzle designer have huge interests in the classics literature and music. I write creatively every day and have done for thirty five years. My mental health issues are ongoing and difficult but when though I suffer in fact because of it I‚Äôm motivated to really do more and more and more. Opportunities are sometimes difficult but at least there‚Äôs nothing to stop me doing research from books and trying to read and listen more. Much more

At a time when resources are constrained I would do all I can myself. I have been spoken of in the same breath as Lewis Carroll and Archimedes in my puzzle skills. I am really keen to find a really original way to use puzzles classical music creative writing. Audiobooks I make myself. Anything to make mental health and well being better. I do not understand why I have had so much difficulty from organisations services and charities in the past from allowing me to do my best for society

There are always always things I can do myself in learning more. From Aesops fables onwards. I just hope to inspire as the best people have inspired me. But it‚Äôs true that deep mental 
Illness its isolating effects can provide one with an unusual and hopefully inspirational insight and perspective on life which one wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily have

I really am at my breaking point and dont really know what else to do. i am only 4ft9 now so as a teen i was picked on a lot in school. it didnt help that i was over weight for my age. long story short i was the girl the lads picked on as if they liked me to wind there mates up or the dear part of truth or deer. as i have got older without going into to much detail i was just used to the point where where they stated if he went near me he was pissed at the time. i got to a desprate point and feel that way again but i cant let it happen again. no one has liked me for me. i have a complete fear that i am not going to have a partner as i dont really get out the house. been around people that are a lot younger then me with the just friends stage but you clearly know something is going on and to thing i am missing that the older i get its just killing me.i dont go out the house and cant even look at a picture of me as i just do not like the way i look.",Forgot there wasn‚Äôt a pic of me I don‚Äôt like taking them because of my size very rear I get a full one,Sorry to hear that but I do have a good friend who works on lifeline in Cambridge so if u want the number let me know
"Hello everyone. 

I'm feeling stuck, I've been feeling stuck for a long time now. I don't want to do the things I know I should be doing to make my life and my mood better. I'm not doing thoes things partly because I don't know how and partly because I have other responsibilities. (mainly family) that are taking up a lot of my time. I'm having to take care of a family member and i am the only one. I have to do the cooking, cleaning, shopping. Than there's also the stuff I have to do for myself. I don't have a lot of energy or motivation to begin with,  and with everything I need to do by the time I'm done I don't have any more energy or motivation left to do what I need to do for myself. (at least the things I know how to do) every day it seems like I have less energy, less motivation and less hope. I just sort of shut down and all I want to do is do nothing,  just stay in bed.","Sounds like you are stressed big time you can‚Äôt take care of others until put yourself first if it continues you might be looking for a break down are you seeing a therapist or maybe a psychiatrist your family needs boundaries I know how it feels to have to be in

"Hi guys. Just want some advice really. 

I‚Äôm at a all time low. Iv been like it on and off since I was 19 (33 now) 
I have 2 boys 10 and 3. One has adhd and emotional issues. I‚Äôm doing all I can to try help him but I‚Äôm so down and miserable myself for reasons I do not know. Lose my temper quite a bit I stress so easily and have no energy to do a lot of things. Sometimes I think i could just remove myself from life and have done. Why am I never happy. I wish I could just snap out of it. It‚Äôs strange cos I have a very supportive family but I just feel so alone. I think I may have bipolar or personality disorder of some sort but when I see doctor they put it down to depression every time. 

I need a big boost In happiness!!!","Hi there. I am sorry to hear you're having a tough time. Have you considered you may have ADHD or perhaps be autistic yourself? These things are genetic. If you are struggling with energy and emotional regulation, this sounds very much like what I have experienced myself and also seen in my neurodivergent friends and clients around me. If you are neurodivergent in some way, you'll likely feel bad because you're not able to tailor your life to meet your needs...simply because you're not fully aware of what they are. Do talk to your GP or reach out to a peer support group for help. Help is out there. But, seriously, as a person who was simply told they had anxiety for years...take some time to find out what the deal is with your brain so you can make the life that it needs. I wish you truly all the very best.","Sorry, one final point. I don't like to assume anything but you don't say if you're a mum or a dad. It shouldn't matter but GPs time and again tell women it's just depression when they're actually neurodivergent. It's what happened to me and to many of my late diagnosed clients. If you want a sympathetic GP, I find the younger ones are more aware of the latest research and are open to the idea that all adults can have things like ADHD."
I have just told one of my online friends that they are no longer a friend. They were making me feel even more useless and inadequate. I still can't stop crying as really hurts. I have one other but probably better to have no one. Then no one can hurt me or let me down. I feel so miserable and lonely.,That definitely sucks.

What does it mean when your heart is beating/racing,"Well, you could start noting down when does it happen. Does it happen when you think about someone or something? Is that a positive thought or does it cause anxiety? Does it happen while you are exercising, taking the stairs? How often does it happen?","Sound like a panic attack.  I know it may sound stupid but breath in through your nose for 10 sec, hold for 5 sec, breath out through your mouth slow. Do that a few times it helps."
"I'm jobless for long years due to my many illnesses which includes some mental health illnesses. I've been able to get odd jobs on and off but never was able to hold onto jobs for long.

I had a major cancer scare at 19 years old, I was diagnosed with mental health illnesses in my early 20s, then other chronic illnesses just accumulated over the long years.

My mom and older sisters would tell me how if I wasn't born, the family would have money to spend and better lives because of the extra cash, not having to spend a single cent on me since I was born.

I'm in my 40s now.

I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't really gamble, just I buy lottery tickets once in a long while.

I've never married, never had kids.

I recently bought a lot of books on various topics, both ebooks and print books. I enrolled in some online courses to pick up new skills.

But I'm procrastinating a lot because of the old fears that I have about me being a loser, living a loser life. According to my mom, if I'm able to pay my own bills, then I'm not a loser.

I'm reading Dr Keith Merron's book called The Art of Transformational Coaching currently to change my mindsets.

How does one overcome procrastination?

Thanks.",Believe in yourself.,"Sounds familiar to me, and I am so sorry family made u feel that way - I think everyone deals differently & you really have to find what works for you but I will say that it sounds like you‚Äôre on the right track- you‚Äôre doing research and reading books- & that shows that you wanna make a positive change in yourself- to me that is HUGE so great job! 
What works for me is establishing a realistic routine. I don‚Äôt put too much on my plate - I have to work because BILLS, ya know- but I started back part time and worked myself up to working more hours- I also write my thoughts in a journal- I do a 10 minute morning meditation or I find a good (uplifting) podcast to listen to while I get ready for the day. I also practice gratitude every morning and throughout the day. I spend time outdoors with fresh air, nature and sun - even just sitting on my porch or walking around the yard- I stay off social media- I have this page and a TikTok but I only follow positive groups and pages- or mental health aware groups and pages - no family or friends- that was one of the hardest changes but most rewarding in my opinion - and I joined an app called circles - it‚Äôs like group therapy but not in person ü´∂üèº 

I hope that helped some - and I wish you the best on your journey!

"Newbie here! Hi everyone! I'm looking for support and suggestions to help my elderly MIL. My parents in law seem to have been hiding that they haven't been able to cope for some time...uncovered when FIL admitted to hospital, and then a nursing home due to falls (advanced Parkinsons). MIL is not coping alone, and I can't seem to get her to see that we need to seek input from Doctor/mental health/adult social care. She's not eating, not sleeping, the house is falling apart (roof leak, holes in floors, kitchen sink & cupboard about to collapse, cooker is filthy and broken, there's mice etc), and there's a hoarding situation going on. Hubby and spent all weekend working there. We replaced the bathroom floor, the toilet and basin, fixing a leak, removed rotting and mouldy groceries (still in bags on kitchen floor), placed rodent poisons. I don't know how to get through to her to let me get help involved, and we don't want to make that decision for her, she'd be so hurt (she's a proud Yorkshire woman who doesn't want to make a fuss). Any suggestions very gratefully received.","We are having her stay over at our house, every few days (especially while we did her house repairs). She said that she's petrified of being alone. She eats at our house, which is reassuring, but I can't convince her to take a bath or shower, which is something she can't manage safely at home. We've had some lovely girlfriend type chats about all sorts (music, birthing & parenting, culture, politics, even health issues like IBS etc.) so she's not shy and we get along well - I'm also a retired nurse. I played it low-key and suggested a nice bath/shower to save her heating bill, and also so I could be nearby in ear-shot if she needed help. Big nope , that would not be necessary thank you. Oops. But she did let me take her to the mobility shop and buy a walker/trolley thing which I hope will give her confidence a boost.",Sounds like she is mentally ill.

"Healthy food is important for mental health.

I am going to have chicken vegetable soup with barley for dinner tomorrow night.

 I will put in three chicken thighs, a package of butternut squash, a package of pearly onions, three carrots, two parsnips and two turnips. I will use two packages no sodium chicken powders, two teaspoons garlic powder, two teaspoons onion powder and two teaspoons poultry seasoning. I will use about six cups of water as my base. I will add 1/2 a cup of barley about an hour before it's done. I will take out the three chicken thighs, let them cool, break up the meat, return it to the pot and throw away the bones. After I dish it up, I will sprinkle in some parsley flakes to give it color. I know that it will be delicious.

I will cook it low and slow for 8 hours in my Crock-Pot. I will start it in the morning and it will be done in time for dinner. I will let it rest before eating after I dish it up.",Healthy food is the foundation of good mental health I agree... I'd also like to note. I love my crockpot. I know I named hi named him uncle sam,Stacy Lynn I know what you mean. I use the food bank and food stamps too. Sometimes they give me things that I can't use or don't use. I share them with my neighbors that can use them. I don't use a lot of canned goods because they're high in sodium. I live in a low income apartment high-rise. We have a set of shelves in the lobby where we can put the food from the food banks that we don't use. That way our neighbors can benefit from that food. Sometimes I find food on the shelving unit that I can use.

"Ignored

Do you remember as a kid that horrid feeling of being ignored? When you fell out with a friend so they used it to punish you? or if you had behaved in a way parents didn't like so they just left you to stew in your own world of loneliness resulting in you feeling trapped and resenting yourself. Sobbing in your room wishing you were an adult so you could at least you had the power to change things....Well here is the gutting blow. I'm a full grown adult now. and being ignored is now pretty much my life...friends of past are just that....I'm just a memory of some fun times they probably giggle over with the present friends. 
Parents??? The more time they get in their life the less I seem to be included. But I guess it's their time to enjoy freedom now I'm grown so I can't blame them. 
Partner ..... urgh... I don't know where to start! Not without going back to the state of sat there sobbing like 7 year old me in my bedroom. Yet now I don't have my own bedroom to go and blub in.... I don't have even the time to cry privately in the bathroom...not without a 4 year old banging the door and shouting "" I need a poo!"" I thought being am adult would be easier but the truth is I'm now ignored by a whole world! yep everyone in it! My family, my children, my husband...and as for being able to change things? I'm more trapped now than ever because leaving in anyway would just damage my children so isn't an option. 
So today I got up at 5am. I'd been feeding and burping the baby since 3am anyway. While gently patting her back and trying to stay awake...listening to husband next to me snoring, oblivious even after many children that this lonely night ritual happens. So I thought I'm going to treat myself to that chance to cry. quietly carrying little one downstairs to hug on the sofa as I wait for the chaos of the day to arrive with loud excited feet rumbling down the stairs in search of breakfast cereal. 
 It's valentines today.... I got hubby a gift as you do. it had been in my shopping basket weeks while I waited to see if I could make money stretch enough this month to buy it. Of course he got me a little something too. he asked what I wanted the other day as he ""better get it ordered"" I sent him the links to a cook book so I could do some baking with the children...He looked up from his lap top 3 minutes later smiled at me and said ""done!""....before resuming the position he will be in till at least midnight of staring at his screen. My only interaction is listening to the odd rant as he opens an email. I can have a full blown chat with him. Tell him something really important and he literally gives me blanket responses while ignoring the content! So now I don't bother. I don't tell him if I'm ill. I don't tell him if I'm worried or upset or need support. Because he doesn't listen. And adding being ignored to the list just upsets me even more. 
Blimey I have ranted haven't I! and if you got to here my gosh I might never know you or speak to you but I am so thankful for you listening to me. I don't know why I wrote all this to be honest. but I've nowhere else to get it all out. and I'm hoping it may in some way help if someone else feels this? Especially today as we all sit watching people post their cards and flowers and posh meals out? 
maybe a 14 year old version of me might read this and manage to avoid becoming this trapped 40 year old version of me eh? 
Anyway. Thankyou for reading and I hope your day is starting with breakfast in bed amd not a lonely dark sofa.

"We're told all out lives that WE are the problem. That we are clearly unstable and mentally ill and everything's soley blamed on that.  Then when we go to therapy we're told that due to past traumas or still ongoing toxic relationships (with others) our minds have been pretty much traumatised into reacting in this certain way. survival mode even. 
However we are still then made to retrain our minds because 'we clearly are making lives difficult for others'. I mean  'how dare we emotionally struggle in response to others being constantly mean to us'. Outside sources deny any wrong doing of course!.
We will always just be labeled as 'mentally unstable'. Technically we're actually abuse victims. Ignored and left to suffer alone for years. Our abusers are hidden within the false security like 'friends and family'. The dynamic causes us more confusion and turmoil. They however have had a constant shield to protect their ignorant, spiteful behaviour. They constantly gas light us into thinking we are the problem. They take zero responsibility yet demand 'we must go on medication' or that 'we must get therapy'. They would absolutely deny they've done anything wrong. THEY WILL ALWAYS JUST SAY ""YOUR PARANOID"" OR ""TOO SENSITIVE"". ""YOUR THE ONE WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES"". 
NO!
They are the real problem. 
Many people have commit suicide thinking that they are beyond broken. When in reality they've just been let down drastically by heartless fakes.

"I need a hug ü•πü•π a lot of the times I feel so alone . And I keep replaying things in my head on how my life just went crazy . I really had a baby my a man that didn‚Äôt love me . I love my baby but it makes me go stir crazy on knowing that. Why didn‚Äôt I have enough self respect to stop messing with him . And I can‚Äôt ask for his help because he treats me like garbage. And it reminds me of how my dad used to treat me . I felt like nothing and for years I mourned not having a father . I tried to fix it , it made me so depressed I have been in counseling for yearsss . Even now I‚Äôm struggling , people make me feel so bad for being a single mom . My pregnancy was unsupportive I had maybe 1 or 2 people. And no one really came to my baby shower. and to think I will have to watch as people are supportive of my sister . I am hurting so much . It‚Äôs literally everyday . I don‚Äôt know how I can keep holding on .","Sorry it's not a real one, but sending a huge virtual huggggggggggg. People tell me hugs are like they wish they're husbands or loved ones would give them. :( shame I can't be out there giving them away, cause I need them also. 

Sorry for what your feeling, just be greatful you have this wonderful being in your life, something many of us have or will never experience. The father is a fool, try not to let him or others spoil the joy of being a mother. You have a reason to live and hopefully someone to look after you when your old. They'll be good times and bad, but that love or bond is priceless. You got this x",Take care and big hugs upon

Hi all so are  basically on this group because I suffer with mental health even though I'm starting to get better now I still have my down days but I am basically on here looking for for people to talk to or maybe be friends because I don't have many I been through a lot last year I'm only literally just putting myself back together but I would still like to talk to people bs something inside me is still telling me that I'm not right ü§îü§î,Just keep going. I have just finally been confirmed as bi polar. Every day just look for positive things even the smallest thing can change the way I look at things. I have hurt so many people through mental illness pushed them all away you have to look after number one. Keep positive,Take care x  I'm struggling too xx you can send me a nessage on messenger and maybe exchange numbers for mutual support x
Hi I‚Äôm getting increasingly worried as I‚Äôve been getting back and side pains under ribs for the last couple of days. It‚Äôs been better today but now feels worse again. I‚Äôm taking Sertraline and Mirtazipine. I‚Äôve googled and it didn‚Äôt calm me down‚Ä¶,Sometimes you can get those pains simply by sleeping in a weird position. If it's still there in a couple days just give the docs a call and see what they think.,Take hot bath and get good sleep dear
I‚Äôm so angry and upset. The drama group In my hospital are doing an exercise where we write our story and apologies and we film another person reading it out so we can hear and see our words in real life. I have filmed two people‚Äôs videos for them but no one will do it for me because of what I did. I used to be an internet troll but I‚Äôm not anymore I have changed and changing everyday. They just won‚Äôt help me.,Sending you hugs. You deserve a second chance and make one for yourself with new people learning from the mistakes made. #nesscares,Take it easy. People can be awkward. Persevere. Keep calm
"After a long conversation with with mental health going deep into what's happened in my life also another phone call today to finish what we started yesterday i found out that's its most likely I have ptsd, this came  as a massive shock as I didn't think it was possible as I always put everything down to life experience and tried to move on, on my own with no help or support, I didn't realise that years down the line it would rear its ugly head and destroy my life completely, and I am  completely devastated it took this long for me to seek help but I always put my mental needs after my childrens and everybody else's. So now for once I need to be selfish and do the hard work that needs doing. Not a road I really want to walk down, but a road that needs crawling down slowly, so after the tears yesterday the self haterd the anger I guess it's time to take the walk I don't want to do. Has anybody got any tips on how to cope with journey please","I am so proud of you for reaching out and getting help that's a massive step, u should be proud too. I have PTSd, my inbox is always open if u need anything x","Take that step buddy and see a professional so you can break everything down piece by piece. It takes time and courage coz it's a painful journey. I'm also suffering from ptsd, mdd,gad,pbd so you not alone at all."
"I lost a baby
I lost a job
I lost a girlfriend 
I started feeling sad during sunset times 
Then i started to feel insecure 
Suddenly, i started to feel like there's things or people following me
Then i startes having sleepless nights 
My ears started ringing
I developed loud noses
I got confused, i was just hearing noises not understanding where they come from.
Nothing was interesting anymore
I didn't enjoy the love life or friendships anymore
I just wanted to be alone yet when im alone i feel like im in the dark and there's this loud noises that keeps on
Pulling me further into darkness. 

Thanks to the antidepressants, although I  hate being reliable on medication., they really helped me find hope and feel strong again.","I'm not an advocate of too much med, but you sounded like you needed this to support for you to feel better and stronger after very  tough times.  I don't think a pill does it all you have a part to play , your doing so well and are stronger than you think, sorry for the stuff in your past ,look forward now,you've got this well done.",Take the medication. Nothing wrong with that. Be happy
"I'm alone almost all of the time. There have been so many things in my life spinning out of control.  I haven't really got any support. I'm looking for a church. I need prayer. I'm reaching out. I'm trying to talk to people I know but they are truly uninterested. I've recently received scary medical diagnosis. I'm having surgery in a little more than a week.  I'm scared. I can't sleep. I can't get my stomach to relax long enough. Any advice, words, positive vibes, prayers, to help me feel less alone.","I'm truly sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing. It takes courage to reach out. As you look for a church, remember that you're not alone, and seeking spiritual support is a positive step.

It's unfortunate that those around you may not be as responsive as you need them to be. Remember that people may not always understand the depth of your struggles, and it's okay to seek support from various sources.

Facing a scary medical diagnosis and upcoming surgery is undoubtedly tough. Surround yourself with positive influences, even if it means finding support beyond your immediate circle. Prayer and the strength of a community can make a difference.

In the meantime, focus on self-care. Practice deep breathing, listen to calming music, and engage in activities that bring comfort. I'm sending positive vibes and keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.","Talk to your healthcare team:
Share your fears and concerns with your medical team. They can provide information, answer your questions, and offer guidance on managing anxiety related to surgery.

Prioritize self-care:
Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and relaxation, such as meditation, gentle exercise, or listening to calming music.

Lean on friends and family:
While it seems like your current attempts to talk to people you know have been unproductive, consider reaching out again. Sometimes people may not fully understand the gravity of the situation, and a direct and open conversation can help.

Positive affirmations:
Remind yourself of your strength and resilience. Positive affirmations can help shift your mindset and provide a sense of calm. Repeat phrases that inspire hope and courage.

I'll be keeping you in my thoughts, and I truly hope that you find the support and strength you need during this challenging time."
How‚Äôs does everyone cope with crippling anxiety (without diazepam)????,"Leave the situation where the anxiety attack began, find (or imagine) something to focus on, whilst regularly taking slow, deep breaths","Talking to my therapist helps, but also finding a hobby you enjoy doing helps a lot. I do coloring, diamond painting, latch hook and cross stitch. Having that variety of activities helps me out a lot so if I'm not in the mood for one I'm usually in the mood for another."

"Just wondering - to any of those who suffer with anxiety or depression... if anyone is actually finding this lockdown a Positive thing?? 
(Just to give you some back ground I work in critical care in the NHS so am not completely locked down due to having to still work)...
Big big love to those who are struggling. But.... The pandemic has had the Opposite effect on me!! The less people and crowds around has eased my anxiety Massively., the less traffic on the road stopped my road rage; the slowing down completely of the whole pace of life has helped me stop my mind from constant cycling and my heart from constant racing; I feel a new sense of Peace that nature and the planet is healing due to the slowing down or stopping of our travel/pollution/industry; 
I have seen a level of kindness and generosity shown by humans that would not have happened had we not have been in lockdown. 
I am actually getting anxious and worried about coming Out of lockdown!! I‚Äôm not ready for it yet üòû","Great comment. Many of those who previously suffered anxiety are finding lockdown/isolation somewhat relaxing.  It's called the lockdown paradox. This is due to the new rhythm of life, collective conscious awakening of germ reduction, more downtime, extra sleep etc...which all bodes well for those who would otherwise suffer anxiety. Nice to see and hear.",Than you now understand I just if your suffering stop hit and have faith really understand that THE women thank for mind words and understanding written we all going through something but he strong find all talent and use it god is all is stay safe be kind

It is absolutely essential for people to keep themselves safe, first and foremost.

You have shared honest and important information. I hope that people can listen and heed your advice.

"After about 2 years of psychotherapy I feel as if I've turned a corner.  I'd like to share my 13 keys to being happy, or at least happier and less anxious/depressed:

1. Respect other people's opinions even when you don't agree, or understand how they could have that opinion.

2. Stop watching television news, except local news.  Read national news from various sites instead.

3. Work on improving yourself and not trying to change those around you.

4. Quit worrying or having anxiety about things in which you have no control and/or won't affect you directly.

5. Stop worrying about being right and focus on being happy.  

6. Debate but don't argue on social media (learn the difference)

7. Don't insult or denigrate anyone at any time.  You may be right but that doesn't mean you don't experience anxiety even when you are.

8. Respect elders, even when you disagree.

9. Be a positive person publicly, work on your negativity privately. 

10. Do more things that make you happy, no matter what they are, and be a little selfish on occasion and do something nice just for you.  

11. When something in the news makes you very angry or upset, focus on why, it's possible, or even likely, that you are actually hurt or upset about something else in your life that you're not addressing. 

12. Enjoy and focus on being present in the moment, not constantly regretting the past or worrying about the future.  

Lastly:

13. Try to really listen to people when they speak to you instead of thinking about yourself or what you are going to say next..","Excellent advice for all, and is just the way I've been living (to the best of my ability)üôè hope it serves you as it has me.",Thank you for this! üíú
"Whenever I post about loss I‚Äôve endured, I hope it doesn‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôm comparing myself to anyone else b/c I‚Äôm not. We all have our story. With that said‚Ä¶
They gave my dad 2-4 months, stomach cancer, it spread to his vital organs. Put everything in order, that‚Äôs it. Finally the Dr said he‚Äôd run a scan to see if surgery could buy a little time, but probably not.
Next week, the Dr stuttered, can‚Äôt explain it, but now it‚Äôs only in the stomach, let‚Äôs do surgery. It worked! Eight days later, Wednesday, mom and I brought him home! My parents were happier than I‚Äôd ever seen them. 24 hours later, I got an emergency call‚Ä¶ possible stroke. I finally reached my wife, who was with my parents.
She said no, he‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ but my mom had the stroke. Sadly she didn‚Äôt survive - it doesn‚Äôt stay this sad, but 1 day into my dad‚Äôs recovery, instead of their new lease on life, this happened. He lived another 7 years, and did well during that time. Why tell this? Because months later, I discovered a different story.
The other story I discovered is that the week before my mom passed was truly sweet - the I love you‚Äôs were said, the family was all closer than ever. Had my mom passed without that precious week, my dad would have lived with deep regret. This changed everything for me.
The story we tell is where we find meaning, and we get to choose how we tell it. The best stories often have the darkest moments. Find the precious story and tell it with all your heart - especially to yourself.","If you're struggling with mental health, having someone listen to you is very important. If you don't feel like you can trust your loved ones, that can be really hard to deal with‚Äîespecially when it comes to talking about your mental health journey.

"Well I want to share my story with everyone. When I was 19 I made a suicidal attempt and jumped off the well known railroad tracks known to never stop for anything, off of a bridge roughly over 60 feet high. During the process I had a police officer negotiator with me on the bridge. When I jumped I fell so hard I did not feel the surface of water.  But the bottom of the rocks crashing into my body. Bottom of river. I swam to the surface and layed on my back watching the night stars till a lifeboat lights hit my head. I screamed as they pulled me out of the river had hypothermia from ice cold waters and standing till night on the bridge in middle of May. 

Ever since I went through heights of terror with mental health and system in general and trying to cope and heal from the life's experience. 

I am 31 now during the progression of the years I fell homeless in city streets. Thought I'd never see a good thing in my life.

Now im housed by professionals that care for me greatly. I have phycologists, nurses, phschiarists, therapists of all kinds that visit me weekly for my care. It's been hell. But I've managed to be beneficial to community by volunteering efforts.

I still struggle have pain that's still there could possibly be there for the rest of my life. But everyday I do something for myself on this journey. I've buildt art and archives of photos I love from aspects of what I decided to document. 

So I hope everyone knows that life does care. Have a wonderful day or night.",I love your story and I am so glad you are able to encourage others so powerful.,Thank you for your story. My heart goes out to you. I too have suffered crippling depression.
"Hi, I've been on Setraline for three weeks now after having taken citalopram for almost 12 years. I found citalopram had stopped working and as a result I'm back to suffering severe anxiety and depression again. I've found Setraline has made me feel worse in terms of anxiety and depression but I'm told to persevere for another 4 weeks for the drug to take an effect. I've had possibly one good day where I felt 75% myself, however, the next day I felt worse again. I'm not sure what I'm asking in terms of support from this group but I suppose some reassurance that I'll be okay would be nice to hear.  Also, before I tried citalopram, I was depressed for years and years and have tried every type of therapy to help overcome it.

Like maybe don‚Äôt drink tell like after 5 go for walks with your son or your pet in the afternoon .,"Thank you so much all for the love and support. I am trying to be strong but so much crap has happened in the last 2/3 years that I feel like I am losing my sanity some days. I have taken a step back to look at who I have become and, I have nothing to look back on and be proud of, maybe apart from doing a degree with the Open University over a periodof 5 years. My son was present at my Graduation ceremony which meant the world to me. I had achieved something I thought was impossible. I owe it, not only for myself,  but also the friends who supported throughout my studies. I want to be a better person and be kinder to myself which I find near on impossible. Anyway, thank you again. In my isolated little world (I am physically disabled as well), it means more than you could imagine. I don't think that the people, who have never suffered from mental health issues, understand how crippling it can be some days."

My lad had a mental breakdown weekend just gone he wanted to end his life  by sitting on a bridge ready to jump. We seen a doctor yesterday and he going to get mental health nurse involved. Any advice he had 2 hours sleep last night. Doctors don't want to put him on medication. As a parent it's not what you want to hear . Any advice be great,Can they not give him diazepam to settle him so he can try and relax it will help until the mht step in worth a askx,Thanks all mental health team rang today they are doing a call on Monday with emergency team . Thanks all your advice xx
How do I overcome not wanting to do anything? I spend most of my day laying on my bed playing with my phone. I've zero interest in getting up. I'm already on 150mg sertraline daily for my depression .,Im the same I lie in bed most days.  Just don‚Äôt want to get up and deal with life xx,Thanks everyone for your support. I ve been dragging myself out to activities so am coping better.
Anyone have advice on how to survive working at home with your thoughts?  I get stuck on certain things in particular my relationship and spiral when I am home working alone.  Also definitely have a problem with ruminating.  It is just getting really tiring,Music and having a dance party by your self!,"Thanks for sharing and asking for help! Here is something I did and it helped me. I put in mandatory (do not skip) breaks in my calendar. During this time I walk around the block, the apartment or the garden. Do not think about the things you need to do after the break. Look at things you see and let your mind take it all in. It doesn't happen in a day or two, but after a week, I felt like I was part of the world"

Of course if you need a chat just post on here, your never alone pal","Thanks for sharing and asking for help! It is not easy to share. I am happy that you decided to move on and stuck to your decision. As adults, it is more difficult for us to meet people and make friends. It is worse, if you are an introvert or have trust issues. I would recommend using meetups to go and meet people. Maybe you don't talk to anyone the first few times, no pressure. But get used to having people around. Soon, when you feel ready, maybe you would talk to someone or who knows, someone might come talk to you. And always, use this group to share, talk. I am here and listening"

am not well. just trying to find any way i can to manage without relying on the as needed meds. as i don't want to get reliant on them. my mom wants me to just take the meds every time i even begin have intrusive thoughts. she doesn't understand that the meds are potentially addictive and that i only have a limited number of them.

the tapering  off of a med  is going ok. even though it's messing with what way round i have my days and nights. the taper off has also brought up some sensory needs that where   suppressed for years. i have it figured outü§ûüèª. and my adult sized pacifiers(yes that is a thing) should  be in on wednesday. no i'm not into adult baby/little kink. am literally getting the pacifiers so i don't continue sucking my thumb to the point of skin issues. 

the biggest problems with my mom is her disrespect and disregard for my sensory needs. her whole view on the topic is that i never had sensory issues for 30 years why now that i have a diagnosis of autism does that change ""suddenly"". 

it's like no they have always been there. they were just forced to be suppressed because  they were seen as inappropriate behaviour and acting out. that was suppressed primarily with antipsychotics medication from the age of 12. along with the use of intentional or unintentional TRIGGER WARNING STARTS HERE:

ABA is in very simple terms a person does what you tell them to exactly how you tell them to it that person gets rewarded for being compliant. it's a very damaging practice that is a BIG no with in the neurodivergent community. often is a cause of trauma",Your mom sounds like mine a controlling person.

"I have been suffering from mental illness for quite some time about 20 years. Recently in the last 18 months I have developed I guess 3 new voices to go along with my regular 3 that I‚Äôve had for the past two decades. Thes voices are much different there definitely foreign like English would be there second language and they make very rude comments about my wife having sexual indescrepancys with them and other men, it starting with them saying they were forcing her to do these things and now has turned into them saying ur wife is a freak we don‚Äôt have to force her to do anything she likes to do these things. The voices come n go and aren‚Äôt constant. Many years ago I was diagnosed  with skitzoaffective disorder. Along with ptsd and bi polar. The voices are loud and clear and seem very real in my home is usually the only place I seem to hear them as if there coming through the vent or by my tv from a miniature speaker. I have tried talking to my wife about this and she gets very upset. So I‚Äôm asking is it possible or likely for me to develop new voices like this are could someone possibly really be missing with me hardcore? Or is this likely really happening they have even went as far as talking bout kidnapping my wife and selling her to sex traffickers! This is almost to much for me to handle I‚Äôm at my wits end and really confused, it seems real to me. But I also suffer from mental illness. I am asking for advice and personal input for my situation, going for now lost in LA Jay.",im also bipolar with psychosis i know how hard it is u think the voices are real or its part of u reality try to take CBT it helps to cop with voices and how to ignore them think of them different i strongly recommend u CBT and DBT to be more mindful,Thanks for the feedback although no one has answered the question I asked about how likely am I  to develop new voices on a factual basis?
"Sorry to post this but going through a terrible time. There's nobody to support me, nobody to reach out to. The worst thing is that even if I did have a 'loving family' I don't really know I'd I could put into words what's wrong.

I have always been down on myself but I had a really bad experience in the summer. I was homophobically abused in my own apartment by a family member. 

Now every time I look in the mirror I feel physically sick! I'm so ugly, fat, horrible and a freak!!

I just wanted to rant, it's hard keeping this inside.

"Hi my names Ian and I‚Äôm new to the group, I‚Äôm diagnosed schizoaffective.

What I want to do here is share my story, and let you know there is a light at the end of this tunnel which is possible through pure strength of will that I know everyone of us has within us. My condition surfaced at 9 years old, this was the result I know due to being groomed by a peadophille.
I was very much an innocent child, I built dens, I played with toys just as a someone younger than 10 should. Unfortunately what happened, well happened, it should never have but it did. It went on for months and my voices presented themselves initially to protect me from what was happening.  Initially I started with five, one woman and four men. Overtime they changed, they became hostile towards me, very aggressive, they‚Äôd pull me down and attempt to destroy me.

As I got older the mood aspect of my disorder began to show, initially just a bit more up or a bit lower than I should be,  it these began getting more and more extreme. As expected when presenting my moods with my gp I was diagnosed depressed. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to share about my voices as I had an agreement, an nda so to speak with them, so I suffered in silence. 
During all of this I met a wonderful woman called Laura, we moved in together, we married and got on with life. 

My voices would continue to effect me, at one point making me forget my wife‚Äôs name for months at a time, forcing me to use pet names as unable to speak hers.  

As the years went on I deteriorated further, this led to a diagnosis of bipolar and in and out of mental health facilities within Nottinghamshire.  During my time within ward b2 in Worksop they discovered my voices and was able to diagnose correctly and medicate me effectively to a point. I was tested on a wide range of antipsychotics, increasing in dose with more and worsening side effects, but eventually found the winning combination. Quetipine 800mg Slow release a day, 25mg quick release for episodes happening 3 to 4 times a day, 400mg of carbamazepine and my antidepressant mirtazipine. 

I‚Äôve always been a relatively big lad but with this winning combo I was around 18 stone in weight. 
In 2021 on march the 6th my wife died. It was our 17th wedding anniversary that day. There was errors made by the paramedics that day, and her heart stopped in my arms and she died there and then. This became the worst day of my life, the trauma gained me three new voices, another very aggressive male and two children. My dosage of antipsychotics increased to a total of 1200mg a day after what happened.  

In our marriage we had a split of responsibilities, Laura cooked and I cleaned, and that worked perfectly, after she passed I had not a clue of where to start, so resorted to being a microwave technician, and a bad one at that. I ballooned further in weight to 22 stone. I‚Äôd given up, so you know what I‚Äôm saying there. One day in September 2021 I had a pizza or something in the oven, at this point I could figure that out, I was sat on the sofa and started feeling pressure on my chest, this ran into my left arm and to my jaw, at that point I knew what was happening, so I tossed my phone away. Around 45 min I came around, and I realised I don‚Äôt want to go yet, I‚Äôm 41 years old I‚Äôve a whole life ahead of me if I want it, and dam it I wanted it. When I felt strong enough (should have called 999 at this point but didn‚Äôt, I know I‚Äôm an idiot!) I walked into the kitchen, I got the bin bags and I cleared my entire kitchen out, coffee, chocolate, ready meals everything. That. night I didn‚Äôt eat.

The following day I went shopping, I went and bought green veg and lots of it, chicken and fish and loads of water.  And this was the beginning of my recovery. I ate smaller portions of only things I cooked, no fats, no sugars, no carbs, no caffeine, I went as natural a diet as I could. I started leaning how to cook and found a passion. Each week I lost around 9lbs a week. Within 4 weeks of this new lifestyle I came off antidepressants after 16 years, in 3 months I‚Äôd stripped over 7stone of body weight.. With the assistance of my psychiatrist and my psychiatric nurse I lowered my antipsychotics.  
I felt the best I‚Äôd ever felt. It‚Äôs coming up to 2 years since Laura passed, I‚Äôm the best I‚Äôve ever been in my life, on a quarter of the meds I was on, I‚Äôm focused, determined, I‚Äôm just over 13 stone I weight which I‚Äôve kept off, and I‚Äôm a bloody good cook.  I‚Äôve met a beautiful woman who I‚Äôm more than happy to tell you I‚Äôm madly In love with.

I‚Äôm not saying I have a cure, because I don‚Äôt, but right now I can walk out the door, I can go to work, I can walk through crowds of people, I can talk openly about what my voices try to tell me to do, and I‚Äôm back in control.  What I am saying is you have a choice, you can choose you path, you can change your life if you want to, and you are not defined by your condition.  There‚Äôs a light, you just have to want to reach for it!

I apologise for this novel of a post, but I wanted to share positivity and hope!

#makepositivechanges #eathealthy #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #domore #positivevibes #weightloss #actdontreact","An inspiration! That's what you are!  I don't usually read such long posts but, you got me in from the very beginning. I'm so glad you found the best of you. Keep on keeping on!!‚ù§",Thankyou for sharing it's wonderful to know of someone who has faced dark times and through perseverance created change. You found a way beyond mere existence to experience and participate in life. X
I don't know what's wrong with me. I was dealing with  narcissistic abuse and some reason I'm feeling guilty for finally standing up to his bs..it's like even when someone hurts me I still feel empathy for them and blame myself,You don‚Äôt have to feel that way and a healing spell is what needs to be done for you so that you can stop been empathy,That behavior of yours looks symptomatic of trauma bonds. You might need therapy to get over that.
This is a huge achievement for me especially with how much I have been struggling recently!!! Just remember it is ok not to be ok and your not alone no matter what feelings are valid and mental health matters healing is a step to recovery every step every day every minute counts this is why I have never given up because I know that I am stronger than my mind and I can take on anything if I set myself a goal I am proud of myself even if other people aren‚Äôt this is a big achievement in my life and I am strong to keep going. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π,That's awesome!!!

"My partner of 25 years ended our relationship 4 days ago, then he tells me last night that he's met someone else and they are going to 'give things a go' (he spent the night at her house 2 days after break up)  .. its broken me, how can he move on that quick, i obviously meant nothing to him. I'm so lost and alone","Sorry your going through this. I know you won't want to hear this but he was obviously seeing her whilst he was with you. My dad did the same to my mom.
Just know that you can do better and what he has done to you will come back on him tenfold","That is really tough, I have been with mine thirty years almost so can understand what a massive thing. The signs that things weren't right may have been there for a while. You need to give yourself time and space to get over before you can even think of another relationship. Hold on to the good things that you had and don't dwell on the negative as I think that was a real achievement in itself to have a relationship for so long. Be kind to yourself."
It's so wrong a person with paranoia and mental  health will only get help off the mental health nurse if that person does harm to her self or others so wrong  üíØüíØ,You just go to your GP and hospital for help,That person sud get help before they do harm

If you have had a really bad time, and every time you have picked yourself up things have gone bad again, in a way you come to expect a bad outcome, so when things are good for longer than expected, you start to expect that bad outcome to happen. 
And you're right, it is anxiety. And it is something that you need to cope with and overcome because when you finally get life so it is good for you, you don't want to self-sabotage any chance of happiness you may have."
Saturday I got a letter from capquest about a 713 bill from 2011 to do with littlewoods Catalogue i said to the woman I've no clue to what she is talking about because i don't i did say that from 2011 to 2016 i had no letters or anything from them because if I did I'd never of got a letter from capquest but because i didn't Receive anything from littlewoods it wouldn't surprise me if it was my second ex gf that did it then put it in my name because that's the kind of person she is.,"If Yoo haven't paid anything at all in this bill for 6 years or more then it is statute barred.
This means that no recovery action can be taken against you at all.
Just call them and say it's statute barred and that they must not contact you again or pass it on.
I had someone knock on my door two weeks ago for a bill from 1999.
He was unaware of its age and when I told him he left very quickly",That's not true I worked in debt recovery. You don't have to pay it and it shouldn't show on your credit file. They have every right to contact you although most won't as no value.

They hey have scheduled me an appointment with a psychiatrist that they recommended me to be a good fit. And they told me that what I am doing is a big step towards recovery. I want to thank everyone who gave me advice and I told my foster parents about what is going on. They fully support about what I want to do and they took my phone and cut contact of my girlfriend who is now my ex. They said that they are proud of me for talking to them about it and even offered me help with anything I need. No questions asked. I feel blessed that all of you and my foster parents support me and I cant even described all of your support.

i am done with my life noone wants to help me whats the point anymore?üòî,"before you seek help from anybody, are you ready to help yourself and care your own body and soul and mind?
defend yourself, if nobody helps, you can start helping yourself self-care is the best care.",The fact that you‚Äôre even writing it means there is a point
How do you avoid negative thoughts,"You don't. You acknowledge them, understand what they signify and correct the situation.","The first step to modifying an unhealthy pattern is to recognize and name the problem that's maintaining it: automatic thoughts. Knowing that an automatic thought is bringing you down can be a big relief.

Once you've named the problem, it becomes much easier to analyze it and find a solution."
Hi I'm in need of some advice/help don't even no what to call it... Iv been going thru depression n anxiety for sometime now to tho point were iv tryed to take my own life n got worse since I suddenly lost mum in August as iv never been good at much I am good at cooking and really enjoy it so I had a idea to give me sumat to focus on and better my self n get a certificate sumat to be proud of ya no.. So  I decided to do a food safety /hygiene level 2 course and if I pass I want to make and deliver Sunday dinners 1 to earn abit extra cash n 2 I want to do it for me for a focus just start small like to see if it takes off ya no and my partner thought it was a good idea and she said she would deliver as I don't drive so I got ball rolling n got all exited n hyped up searching for ideas for flyers n everyfing then yesterday out of blue my partner said wots point in doing all this just for you to fail and then said she won't deliver the dinners coz cba to run around on a Sunday.. And it made me feel like shit to the point were am in tears heartbroken kinda am crying while writing this post.. I feel like a failure before iv even started.. I was on such a high just to be n feel put down by someone who suppose to love me.. My partner says am over reacting she don't see she's said or done owt rong.. So am thinking am I over thinking things or wot... Need help/advice owt.... Sorry for essay and cheers for reading,Can you not register on just eat or hire someone to deliver it or even still say collection only for the time being? Sending hugs you've got this! Xxx,The fundamental delusion - there is something out there that will make you happy and fulfilled forever.
"When I hate feeling like im drowning,  yet cant seem to get the support, care, love or understanding from family.  

I hate how my dad is yet am getting to the point im not letting it gey to me as much,  good or bad im blocking my emotions towards him. Couse bad things happen. 

Mum doesn't believe anything is wrong even after reading my journal,  finding oit i spent the first 3 months of the year off my antidepressants,  deep thoughts,  selfharm,  not coping.  Yet days after saying I had problems im not alone says that i there is nothing wrong and im doing it to myself. 

Mentally,  im drowning in silence.  Emotionally i bottle up afraid to show. Socially I dont have friends or go out. 

Mental health will be the end of me.  I need help too afraid to get it alone.","While it's important to feel like you need to block those emotions caused by those people, it's more important to change your response to those emotions. Not block them, bury them etc. Unresolved powerful emotions that we try to bury or block will cause damage from the inside. Depression, stress, anxiety will all increase. I was like this. I'm not an emotional person, never really have been. I bottled up everything because I thought that was the man thing to do. It was the most miserable time in my life. It almost cost me my life, twice. You are the most important person. To yourself. Before anyone else. Gaurd your mental health like it's the most valuable treasure you have. I'm in a far better place mentally. It's a daily challenge and struggle sometimes. But I'm not a victim anymore. I want to survive and commit myself to do that. You can do the same.",The longer you hold it in the harder you will fall when you get so overwhelmed and fall apart it may be a good idea to go back on medication and maybe therapy
"This is my first post, hello all. I find my thoughts/world view alien to most people making me feel like the alien. I'm not looking for advice or understanding because my mind like all of yours is a complicated labyrinth. To be listened to is all's I want at this moment. I'm here because I don't know where else to turn, I distrust the medically assigned minders of the mind because they study from books and don't have first hand experience or knowledge of what they are talking about. So this is my introduction, Hello.","Very true trust your gut, don‚Äôt give up on yourself!",The medically assigned minders are largely under the control of big pharma..once you realise this it sets you out and people think you‚Äôre strange!
"I'm hoping someone can help me out with this one xx

Long shot but the doctor has prescribed me some medication they've told me I need to give it a week to kick in, but it's taking my anxiety over the roof! I now see people putting there heads up to my windows and it's proper freeking me out! 

This started around 5 days ago at a small level now I'm currently laid in bed with my curtains closed, do I trust them and give it until Monday when they reopen or what else can I do? It only happens in the dark though but there in the street to!

"People want me to go to group therapy this is one of the reasons I don't want to go, bcus the therapist will only want to talk about the past something i don't want to talk about bcus it brings up really bad memories that I'd rather not relive bcus they are that bad I'm not going to say wot bcus i don't want people feeling sorry for me or pity.","Ok so you don't want to group therapy and talk about the past.

"Can I ask you all a question and I would really appreciate the honest no bs answers. I am in a fairly new relationship. 4 months or so. On the whole extremely happy but little snippets of my partners past keep coming to light (sexual things, ex partners ect). Now I always thought we were very open and honest to each other but when asked about these past things my partner denies them and later on tells me the truth. Now I understand we all have a past, jesus I have one but I've always been honest about it so it cant come back to bite me and I am unable to comment on these past events ect because it was before my time but am I right to feel like shite about it and kinda a feeling of betrayal. I feel sick and cant sleep. It's making me look at her in a different way. I'm really struggling!!",Mate I think you may be overthinking the whole thing. It doesn‚Äôt really matter what yours or your partner‚Äôs background was just enjoy each other and leave the past in the past and look forward to a happy relationship in the future.,The past is in the past but you also learned some powerful lessons boundaries are important let your experiences guide you in your relationships but also remember people do make mistakes

Mind also often do drop in sessions and sometimes 121 stuff, so definitely worth an ask. Again I know my local mind has a drop in service from 7 till 11 every evening. 

Otherwise search for other local charities, a lot of them have popped from individuals who needed support like us, but found little there.

They are often called cic's (comunity interest companies) there almost everywhere also. U hey might help, maybe Google search mental health cic and your location or on fb. Might take a bit of hunting, but they'll be something somewhere.

"Hi everyone

Considering the fact that people in the UK, particularly in London, are depressed and anxious, where does it come from exactly?

In my opinion, there's one factor which is our schooling system. I'm not here to raise any propaganda or controversy. But to find a root cause and fix it.

The reason I could mention for such an opinion is recruitment of more female teachers and staff and having a co education system. I'm not against women empowerment at all. 

All I want to say is that the co education system should be limited till a certain age group, like until 7 or 8 max. 

Boys need male role models and girls need female role models. 

As per my observations, boys and even men have adapted feminine nature. People are overprotecting/under protecting their kids, which is destructive for their future. 

I believe that boys need male role models in schools to groom properly and get well nurtured. 

Don't you think our schooling system should change? 

What's your opinion?

I'm open to criticism, but within boundaries because this is a genuine concern.","Not only in London it‚Äôs other countries too and some schools in other countries kids get beaten up by teachers so UK is best to be honest depression happens to anyone young old due circumstances family, financial, or just mind that can‚Äôt handle problems needs human help.",This is a interesting topic you raise. I also heard that there are a lot of people drinking drug taking and bed hopping too out here which is worse than what you have just suggested. It is our upbringing following our surrounding that makes us who we are. At the end of the day.

Anyone else like this have any tips on controlling it?,"When we suffer from mental health,be it a life long struggle or a recent or intermittent occurance,we automatically lose faith in our selves and our abilities.As well as dealing with others who seesaw between platitudes and genuine supportive behaviour.If your good at your job and competant then i would suggest bolstering this in your head.Pat yourself on the back mentally when you achieve,accept compliments by looking people in the eye and saying thank you,or i appreciate that.The battle against these insecurities starts with the smallest of steps.Be proud of yourself for starting work each day and fulfilling your role to the best of your abilities.Remember you are unique,but your not alone.Give yourself the faith you deserveü§ó
Explore your life emotionally and detect what negative impacts are infiltrating your life outside of work which could be affecting your mental health overall which is then backlashing to your work life,iv found this to be the most common cause.

Im just attached to him. He left and then blocked me on everything to where I couldnt contact him. Im so desperate I found other ways to text him and then we would say a few words and he‚Äôd block me, then I used text now and he just got so annoyed because I kept nagging him. But he doesn‚Äôt understand that I love him with all my heart and that you can‚Äôt just leave someone in the dust with no type of explanation.

How are you sitting around laughing with ur friends and saying how u would f other girls and saying they are attractive. It just gets me to start thinking.

He told me I acted like I didn‚Äôt care and didn‚Äôt love him but I lost myself and I don‚Äôt even know who I am anymore, I don‚Äôt even love myself and I gave him everything i had in me.

"Good morning all. At first I didn't know if I should write this anonymously, but then I just thought I'm not embarrassed by my situation, I'm just damaged by it and id like people to see the face behind the pain. I hope I can find some advice that can help. 

Long story short. In 2011 i was made homeless by my ex partner who I have/had 4 children with, because she had an affair. In june 2011 she then stopped access because I was unable to agree to her demands because of my housing situation. Since then I did everything I could to gain access through the family law  courts, but nothing at all went in my favour. My ex made me a promise that I'd never get to see them ever again. She has done an amazing job in turning my kids against me, and she has been true to her word. After years of fighting, 2 years ago I recieved an adoption order from the courts. Her new partner had applied to adopt my 4 beautiful kids. Yet again I fought this but yet again I failed as the kids wanted the adoption to be granted. So I had nothing else I could do to stop this. 
This has sent me to the edge and I have no idea how to control my state of mind. 
In 2017 I married my now wife and I have another amazing daughter with my wife and 2 step children, but my old life is having a huge impact on my life as it is now. And to top it all off my kids only live 5 minutes away. I just can't deal with it all. My daughter now is always asking questions about her brothers and sisters and it absolutely breaks me. I understand what I think needs to happen, but I just can't do it. I feel my brain is wired wrong these days, I can't control my emotions, my anger and hatred. I feel so strongly that the system has failed me as a father, just like it fails many other fathers.",Just be honest. Not in angry way. And seek counselling. It won't get you over things but may help you deal with things a bit better. I've sent you a quick message to make you feel amazing ‚ù§,"This story hit hard as it‚Äôs almost identical to mine.  I‚Äôm a mum though. Im finding it difficult to get help for the trauma of it all as I‚Äôm just so hateful and belittling of any professional that‚Äôs put in front of me. It was the court system and misdiagnosis from mental health services that lost me my oldest 2 children 15 years ago. I had contact with them for a year in 2021 after 13 years apart but although they got to see that everything they‚Äôd ever been told about me was lies, the damage was done for all of us.  My youngest daughter lost her siblings twice üòî it‚Äôs going to be a long and traumatic life for us all. Thank god it will all end one day for us all."

"Saying that someone who suffered from clinical Depression was a selfish person after they commit suicide. is the same logic as saying someone (who died from a heart attack) was selfish for allowing their arteries to become blocked. People separated the person from the illness. You wouldn't dream of saying well that's selfish!. They didn't bother looking after themselves, it's their own fault etc. 
But in a suicide the Depression is forgotten. They are always held 100% accountable.

The word ""forever"" was invented to make you feel stuck. Nothing lasts.

Happiness doesn't last forever and neither does sadness. The people you love won't stay with you forever also you'll never stay with someone you dislike forever. Everything comes to an end. If you're happy one day, you can expect that it'll never last, same as if you're sad you must believe that one day you'll feel the abundance of happiness. Love comes with pain and pain finds its way back to love.

Slowly and eventually, you see that the sun finds its way to the ocean. So, you got to keep going. You got to keep driving yourself every day until one day you find yourself ""FOREVER"" and that's the only ""EVERLASTING"" experience.‚ù§Ô∏è

Sounds like we both suffer from being able to set boundaries with our moms. Lol. You made me realize that I should pray about that and too also pray for her to heal. She has issues.

"Hello, thank you for having me. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Walter, and I'm a 45 yo gwm, recovering from drug abuse. I've recently started fearing my age, feeling like time is running out for me to get my sh*t together and get my life on track, and get to where I want to be in life.","Hi Walter. I have a history of substance abuse when I was younger. The first step was to get myself out of it when I found out I was pregnant. My son was the reason I stayed clean. I find that not looking at the bigger picture but setting myself some tasks every day, rather than stay in bed, gives a sense of purpose, even if it is only doing some cleaning or seeing a friend. There are various Mental Health charities around. Ask you GP to refer you to a coordinator. When I was 48, I started a degree with the Open University which, amongst other things, led to new friendships. I graduated when I was 53. It is never too late to do something positive with your life, no matter how  insignificant it may sound. I still battle with depression on a daily basis but I know that every day is a victory for having survived it. I owe it to my son, who has already lost his father to cancer, and my 2 grandchildren. You have more strength in you than you think.",Walter Tate I am sorry to hear you feel that but I am glad you felt comfortable sharing.

Hello everyone. I have suffered with anxiety and depression for years but was yesterday told I have PTSD caused from childhood trauma.

I‚Äôm a qualified hypnotherapist and have worked with people with this condition. If you need a chat please feel free.,Watch out for people on Facebook who offer so call professional advice there are a lot of fraud  I suffer from PTSD I used to self harm because I couldn‚Äôt take the pain it was causing me the trouble is when you self harm it only takes the pain away for a few minutes no matter how many times you self harm the only way I stopped was to talk and talk about everything even though it was painful I cried a lot I thought I wouldn‚Äôt make it sometimes I am still in therapy but I don‚Äôt self harm I have learned how to asked when I need help I pray that you find someone you and trust and share your pain don‚Äôt blame yourself

Is there ever an end to this pain I feel on a daily basis? Do I move on? Do I stay? Do I just disappear? I'm totally clueless as to what I should do with myself and I hate it because I know what I want but it's so far out of my reach that I may never get it back.

The support out there really isn‚Äôt great, I can‚Äôt fault the MH Nurse at my Dr‚Äôs surgery, but other services are shocking.

"I don‚Äôt know where to begin but last summer after a long time of being at odds with my husband because he had cheated on me I finally agreed to give it another go
We booked a holiday and set about opening a new business. 
Two days befre he started being really aggressive and was using cocaine 
I ended up going by myself and having. Listened to all his criticism I then went to Turkey and had a gastric sleeve 
Wjen I got home we where separated but it‚Äôs hard wjen you lived ate entwined and selling up home amd business or giving it another go was a chioce I was not completely comfortable
With but 20 years is a lot to throw away 
It tore me apart last time literally could feel my insides ripping 
I no longer feel like that - 
But habe been making the best  of life amd it‚Äôs been ok .. 
tonight we fly out on holiday except he‚Äôs done it again off his head telling lies then telling me that didn‚Äôt happen
When I went without him
Last time he got between me and our daughter had her fooled hook line and sinker that I was mentally ill and all this drama was because I needed help . 
So what do I do today - 
Holiday all pre booked amd paid for I got ¬£100 in the bank 
That‚Äôs it 
I got family to stay with (I did have bit my brother in law hit on me last time ) 
If I leave my daughter will stay because of work and he refose a to leave I feel trapped to protect her and myself - 
Do I go on my own 
Or is the safest thing to agree to go with him as he demands 
He will not go alone and says that he only didn‚Äôt stop doing frogs cos I don‚Äôt have the right to ask it 
I might point out I am a recovering addict 
He tried to get me back on it amd I refused and asked him to get rid 
My educated self tells me he just don‚Äôt want me or the holiday but he‚Äôs cruel 
And I don‚Äôt feel safe to stay or go tbh",Decided  not to go and finally get me and my daughter away from here,We are in a bed and breakfast

I‚Äôm new here and thankful I was allowed to join. I have struggled with mental health issues most of my life. One of my many struggles is with feeling rejected. I tried to join two other ‚Äúmental health support groups‚Äù and was turned down. This has made my current bout with depression worse. I‚Äôm grateful this group let me join. Thank you!,You are very welcome my dear. I think there is a lot of rejection for people who ae physically or mentally ill. Money is so important to us all but some people are over the top. When you feel stronger look into what support is offered to mentally ill people. Some voluntary groups are more accepting. My psychiatrist wouldn't allow me to have counselling and told some of the supposed voluntary groups not to speak to me. I think that is disgraceful unprofessionally. Yes it is very painful to be isolated. I was a voluntary out patient looking for support because I was sexually abused as a child,Welcome to the group I pray it helps you.

I‚Äôm losing it. I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to anybody about my entire self. I can‚Äôt talk to my family about my unhealthy relationship I can‚Äôt seem to let go of and I can‚Äôt talk to her about my family - they hate her and also don‚Äôt accept I‚Äôm a lesbian - I feel ashamed to tell my therapist everything and I‚Äôm battling inside myself constantly against my head and my heart. I KNOW my relationship is NOT healthy - even abusive - and I feel like there is something wrong with me because I still am connected and can‚Äôt let her go. I get drawn in and I let it happen and it‚Äôs bad for me. I feel like I‚Äôm one person sometimes and then another other times and I‚Äôm afraid to be either all the time or can‚Äôt seem to get it right about who I am. Then I freak out thinking I lost everything but yet I think I‚Äôm losing my mind. I feel like I can‚Äôt tell anybody my entire story and I don‚Äôt want my people to be ashamed of me. I am ashamed of me. For letting myself go back and putting up with it. But I can‚Äôt seem to let her go. She reels me back in and my heart keeps hoping but then she cant change who she is and I‚Äôm not able to move on. I‚Äôm losing my mind.,Note therapists aren't always great to tell shit too I learned that hard way lmao üòÇ,"Well done for posting and reaching out. You have recognised that things are not right and that's a start. At the moment even though your relationship is not good it's what you have, it's all you know and it's pretty scary to take big steps to leave and go to the unknown. For a while you have probably been looking at things through rose tinted glasses and your parents may have seen or been able to recognise things that you didn't want to accept. Every parent wants the best for their child however old they are. If the problem is that you are a lesbian then that's a different issue. You have a right to choose your sexuality but must have a partner that treats you well. 
THE BIG QUESTION what do you want in the next few months . Take small steps. Can your partner give you what you want based on the abuse. I don't think so. You need to talk to someone who can help you , talk get it off your chest, make a plan , if necessary move out or get your partner to move out. Get yourself in a happy place and build bridges with your family. Life is too short and no one deserves to be treated badly. Take your first steps today"

"Hi, I‚Äôm disabled due a car crash I had in 1993, which has resulted in two spinal surgeries and I‚Äôm looking at a third if the nerve block fails. Because of the constant, never letting up pain my mental health is suffering. We haven‚Äôt been getting on for years so after yet more rows which our 13yr old daughter hears we‚Äôve both asked each other for a divorce. Now this has caused more rows because he is controlling, wants everything his own way. I wasn‚Äôt aware I was in this sort of relationship until my best friend told me after she caught sight of him doing it (or trying to) to her. 
I‚Äôve tried to keep things normal but it‚Äôs hard, my depression is making me feel so low that I can see no way out. After being the main parent who looks after our daughter, she has decided to live with him which hurts but it‚Äôs fine I can work around that. But yesterday I find out (with him throwing it at me) that they want to move to Wales. I said to my daughter and what about our relationship? She said I can visit????????? This broke what little I had left. 
I left the house and went to my best friends house for three hours where I cried and cried. I‚Äôm now waiting to get through to my GP as I can‚Äôt carry on like this. My current antidepressant is at its maximum dose so in order to get onto another stronger one I have to reduce from this one.  

I don‚Äôt know what to do now",Control is a crime...involve police,"Well my advice is your daughter as she moves into her teens will see him for how controlling he is. Teens also like control. But o guess (sorry if this is harsh) he‚Äôs offering something new and excitingüòä
I guess the question is - what can you offer to counteract that?
I know how you feel from my own divorce etc etc but I also know (I‚Äôm now 69 and living a full and happy life with my depression/anxiety mostly under control thank god)
I have seen myself like you are now. It‚Äôs not nice to live with for yourself let alone a blossoming teenagerüòä
Let it happen
You have a huge goal
Work step by step to attracting your daughter back into your life
You can visit. Make those visits upbeat and fun
Don‚Äôt let her see your inner turmoil show her the vibrant mum
We can all do it! Not hard to act outü§™
I‚Äôm certain you will win her back but don‚Äôt slag him off to her remember she‚Äôs made the choice maybe with some coercion from dad but you must respect that or she will not respect you
Tell her how you feel ffs you‚Äôre a human entitled to feelings but show her you love her enough to let her go
Believe me it will work
The power of positive thought will help you
See if you can get some CBT and they will give you the tools for dealing with your worst moments
You must want this more than anything else and you WILL get it
Good luck 
Love and be loved 
Smile and you will get smiles back

Getting fed up with people and deleting my social media presence 

Remember the toxic girl I talked about? I cut her off in silence cause there‚Äôs no use to talk to someone who‚Äôs stuck in their own ways and plays the victim( did multiple times) also I cut myself off discord completely 

I don‚Äôt care how this will sound and don‚Äôt question cuz I don‚Äôt gotta say anything but the more I elvove myself and I open my third eye more and I become the high version of myself I see humans never aligning with me and stuck in their ways 

The trick about humanity is to elvove is how the universe works but NONE of you are doing that so I cut you off cuz I don‚Äôt wanna be stuck in the same place 

I don‚Äôt wanna feel every single time I speak that I did something wrong 

I don‚Äôt wanna feel that I did something wrong when I‚Äôm around that person when I never did 

I don‚Äôt want the survivor in me to be brought out when around them 

I wanna be myself when I‚Äôm with them and behave as I please without control

Humans have habit so I‚Äôm missing talking to them and toxic ppl but

I'm on medication which is probably making it worse, but I've dealt with genetic mental illness my whole life. I'm sick of taking every day one day at a time and I just want pain to end. üò≠ü§ç",I feel the same love it's exhausting  x,What you have to realise is this. When you have depression or MH issues you have 2 minds. You have your 'normal' mind and your 'depression' mind. Your depression mind is sometimes stronger. It'll make you believe things that aren't true. Always remember that you depression mind NEEDS you to feel bad.. because that's its purpose. So next time you feel scared about the day ask yourself 'am I really scared of the day? Or is my depression mind making me believe that?'... Next time you're outside and nervous and feel like you need to call someone ask yourself 'am I really scared? If I didn't have mental health issues would I even be thinking this? Or is my mental health mind making me believe it's true when it's not?'.. I need you to really understand what I'm saying here because I've helped so many people with this advice and when you really understand it you'll start using it without thinking. I had someone message me a couple days ago and she told me that she was feeling like no one loves her.. so she said she asked herself 'am I really thinking no one loves me or is it just my depression mind making me feel like that?'.. and she said it helped her. Our depression NEEDS us to believe these things. It's so powerful that it can consume us. But once we start questioning those bad thoughts.. we start to take a little power from it. So start asking yourself those questions and you start taking some power back and give it to your normal mind. Your depression isn't YOU.. it's just a part of you that is controlling you.

Today is the time I have realised that I have wasted my life doing things and looking after others, rather than myself. I have really ran out of time for me to get good at something to be proud of. Spent alot of time looking after family. Today on Christmas day was in bed and dinner was a ham sandwich, looking after mom. I am pulled in all directions but do not go anywhere. I don't want 2023,as should have gone in 2020 when I was really ill.
Now 9.00 o'clock at night seems late, only 2 good friends, no relationship since my divorce over 25 years ago, not even a date.
I am socially lost, can't talk to new people and what I is the point if I feel guilty if not looking after family.
I do not know what to do.

It always affects my relationship. How can I control my emotions üò´. Please I need help",Definitely look further into some help. My ex partner didn‚Äôt seek help about this and it destroyed our relationship too. Recognition is the first step then seek help. Be open and honest and value your partner enough to do this.,"While I don't believe there's a quick fix, anger is an emotion which is designed to spark action. Anger tells you there's something hiding underneath, not yet dealt with.
Getting to know the cause of your anger beyond 
- He pissed me off
- They did something that made me really angry
etc.
Is key to managing your anger.
It's something I'd suggest you work with a therapist on, and yes, there are medications which will lessen the outbursts while you do the work."
"I've just found out a close freind of ours passed away Xmas day. I am an empath and before I found this out a few strange things happened. Firstly I was sat in the bedroom Xmas eve leading into the early hrs of Xmas day wrapping my boyfriends presents. It was during the early hours I felt like someone or something scratched me. At first I was a bit perplexed even paranoid that the entity from our old place had followed us from our old place or that what was here either wasn't benine or somthing more sinister was here or that the suggestion something icky had attached its self to me was true. The second thing that happened was I was convinced something bad was either going to happen or had happened. Usually thease hunches are right. The third thing that happened was I felt something or someone enter and pass through me! Again quite common for me and I gey round it by telling what ever it is to leave me alone and kindly do one.

I've always had empathic skills bit only just in last couple of yrs discovered the explanation for thease skills. At first I seen it as a curse but then after attending a healing light fayre and speaking with a lovely elderly lady who was a medium helped me discover its a gift. She also informed me I had a physcic ability.  

The recent event has knocked me for six and I'd like to know how do others cope with the guilt and thoughts that you could of somehow prevented or acknowledged it streight away  xx",R.I.P,Whilst events like these are often unexplainable I myself have experienced this where I felt a presence touch my skin on a day of family members passing.

Hi.  Can someone help with advice on how to handle this.  My husband has upset one of our neighbours.  He was talking to let‚Äôs call him Fred who lives next door to lets call him Peter.  Peter is a Scouser.  My husband was talking to Fred about Scousers in general and make a tongue in cheek remark about them.  Peter was ear wigging on this conversation and only heard this part and didn‚Äôt hear the part that was complimenting Peter.  He walked away and then sent a message to myself and my husband saying that him and his family won‚Äôt be attending my husbands 50th birthday party this weekend and that their son is not allowed to play with our son anymore.  We have both sent messages to him saying he only heard part of the conversation but he has chose to ignore our messages.  This is the third time in 2 weeks my husband has upset someone recently with so called banter.  My anxiety is through the roof at the moment.  I just don‚Äôt know what to do!  He is under a lot of pressure with work at the moment and I feel he always has to put on a bravado to prove something when a lot of the time it is a cover up with how he is feeling inside.  He won‚Äôt talk to me about stuff and we just aren‚Äôt getting on very well at the moment.  My anxiety is through the roof right now.  Please help!,"I would advise to actually speak directly to you neighbour explaining and apologising for the upset the comments caused. 
Your neighbour is actively hurting and so avoiding your texts. 
They were obviously good enough neighbours to invite to the 50th party so I‚Äôm guessing damage control in person rather than texts, is what‚Äôs needed to mend this situation. 
Good luck",With regards to your husband- gentle understanding and explaining as to his social skills is needed. I think everyone is struggling with their skills and stress of the constant full-on of the last few years xx

"Evening everyone,

They‚Äôre loads of little bits that having been running through my nut lately. I‚Äôve managed the majority of them but this one repeats in my head a million times a day. 

My ex partner left me around 4 months ago. For the first month or so I was heavily on the booze  to try and forgot. I ended up in hospital. 

Me myself i have cerebral palsy and have been in a wheelchair all my life. Growing up as a kid I never thought I‚Äôd fit in. Always thought people would look at me differently because of the wheelchair always had my doubts about myself. 

My pals over the years stopped me from thinking these things because they‚Äôre fantastic people.  I love to have the crack and banter nothing is ever too far for me with my pals. 

Very quickly my ex partner told me she didn‚Äôt like my pals because of the crack we had. I got that to a certain extent because we are very dark. 

She said she‚Äôd only want the best for me but behind closed doors. Was saying things such as:

I‚Äôm only with you because I‚Äôm bored and for charity. 

You‚Äôre nowt without me. 

You‚Äôll get nowhere in life. 

I have had people say these things before but for some reason with her it really has cut deep. Months down the line I still sit here and cry thinking well if she said what she said it must be the truth. 

We haven‚Äôt spoke since the middle of August I still have the urge to ask if she‚Äôs OK and how she‚Äôs doing full well knowing she doesn‚Äôt give a flying fuck about me anymore. 

Everything she said is repeating over and over in my head I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I have a complete understanding that we are over and there‚Äôs no going back. I just don‚Äôt understand why it ended I never got any answers. 

We spoke as friends for a month after we split. She told me she‚Äôd always be there for me. One day she just woke up and told me we could never speak again why I‚Äôve got no idea. 

She owes me money but I ain‚Äôt gunna chase it. I still care so much about her. The things that she said have me contemplating my life yet I‚Äôm still worrying how she is. Ôøº

It doesn‚Äôt make sense my head is all overÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº

‚ù§Ô∏è xx","Bro, she cut you down to make herself feel better.  You were the victim of emotional abuse and manipulation.  She planted seeds, watered them and left your garden to grow wild.

Figuring out what you need over your wants, and pursuing those needs, will set you on a better course. As for the aggression.. breathing. I don't mean how you normally breathe but, deep breaths.

M upset cos my dad fell over and hit his head on the concrete a week ago but he didn't go to the hospital and his head still hurting so m worried that he's gonna die but still won't go to the hospital. Also my dog's unwell too cos he's got degenerative disease and he had a hair cut 2 weeks ago and since then he's not been moving much or wanting to go outside for long so I think he's upset about it and the groomer hurt him cos she cut 2 of his skin tags. Also I can't get a job so m worried what will happen to me when dad dies :'(,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It's completely understandable that you're feeling upset and worried about your dad's health and your dog's well-being. It's crucial for your dad to seek medical attention for his head injury, as persistent pain can indicate underlying issues. Encourage him to see a doctor for a thorough evaluation.

As for your dog, it's concerning that he's not moving much after the haircut. Veterinarian advice is essential in this situation. They can assess if any harm was done during the grooming and provide appropriate care for his degenerative disease.

I understand that job concerns are adding to your stress. It might be helpful to focus on one step at a time, addressing the immediate health issues first. Reach out to friends, family, or support services to share your concerns and explore potential solutions.

"So here is my story.  I hope this helps someone realize they are not alone...
July 25th of last year.  482 days ago, I made a horrible mistake and got horribly drunk.  I lost a fiance in the argument and my cousin threw me out and I became homeless.  I deserved to be thrown out, I have battled alcohol for over 25 years, but I have now been sober for 481 days.  I am still homeless and I have had to go through some very hard things.  I lost a friend and cousin to suicide during this period of time. I sleep in my little truck most of the time, and discovered I have DID in January which told my story of how I was brutally abused by my Dad from the ages of 2 and half till 9.  Before all of this in the last 7 years, 2 divorces,jail,best friend death,cousin who was like my sister death,lost baby which made 4 list babies in the last 25 years.  I work my butt off at work and I am trying to get myself back to being ""normal"".  Yet I don't know what that is.  I am telling you all of this because I never want you to feel alone.  I get it!  You have a friend here!  Please never give up, hopefully your story will help someone else.  You may not have heard this today, but you are loved.  I love you!","I agree sharing a story helps people see others are experiencing or have experienced  similar or something we never considered.  Lets also remember you could still possibly struggle if none of these bigger things have happened,  its a very good idea share your bad day and tips of anything that helped you feel better. Let people know how they can help or you require it. Here for example you hear I deserved that and I hear it a lot. We need to help people in their tough times at their lowest too , that's is also for me a hard bit of mental health.  When someone has supported you,when you are better maybe just remember to let them know either sorry or thank you because sometimes maybe relationships will need healing. Its sad division can occur from mental health. Do you recover or do you simply learn to cope. But whatever one simple message really is you are not alone.",Xx

"Second time this has happened to me in my life, but it scares me terribly.  I fell asleep, on my back last night, very shortly thereafter I had a vision / dream that I was under water, drowning and I could not catch my breath.

I was shaking, head hurt and my heart was beating hard, chest was sore for a bit.  It happened a few years ago, similar thing, just in this dream I was being held face down in shallow water, drowning.  The effects of that dream had my chest paining for a whole day.

Hi. I am new to the group. I have depression and anxiety and been on treatment for over 20 years. I also have MS and most recently been diagnosed with a rare neuralgia called Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia which is an extremely painful condition. I get this shooting pain through my tongue and it happens just as I am getting off to sleep. I have been on a high dose of a pain med called Lyrica and they are talking about changing over to amytriptyline. However I just read the information about it and it flags fluoxetine as a possible drug interaction. Fluoxetine in my main antidepressant. Has anyone ever been on both these at the same time? And has anyone had Serotonin Syndrome? I am just scared cause changing the delicate balance could go badly wrong‚Ä¶,"I think it will depend on what doses you're on of each medication...and whether you're on other meds, or still on Lyrica.
It's so hard with medications to get them working well together. And it's at times near impossible to say what's doing what with side effects. 
I feel a bit concerned though that your Dr has prescribed Amytriptyline when you're on Prozac already. 
I think I have heard that Serotonin syndrome is more likely to occur with the older tricyclic anti-depressants.",Yes me on both. I have never felt better. Get a little tired from lyrica. But do sleep well

If you are learning through your mistakes- that takes courage. No one in this life knows it all and we are learning through our experiences.

"I had a meltdown to my psychologist  yelled at her I looked at her I'm like have you ever seen the worst, the people that never leave the hospital? She said yes, I said that's where I was.... and I told her I tell people they don't get it like you better be a real professional lmao. Like I got feelings that I don't understand lmao. She just sat there and listened to me after that. I looked at her I said can you tell me why they want all my testing and information to inject me every month? She said nothing. It was an emotional session my phschologist said they will cover Lunas surgery I had meltdown even after that.That news should of made me happy right but I went off about all the testing I've had colonscopy, colpscopy, mri, excercise tests, diabetic tests, ever test imaginable...ect. Then we argued about how it's a delusion in my head. But a photo or archive isn't enough to say it's real. Evidently I'm delusional I got mad when she called me sick. I've said I've heard it my whole life why can't people accept reality of what I am now. Then she said I do have a place in life. Why do I feel so shitty like honestly, I feel like I can't trust life lol. I tried to tell her I'm clinically a paranoid skizophernic these thoughts just don't stop for me. Why do I feel bad that I'm not understanding as well as being understood. I just need like peace for now something defintly strange.

And then I read my psycologist this

Like a messiah would claim. That there's so much understanding for alien life. It's real. Experiences. The significantly unexplained. The treasure of life. The surroundings that stand like a stone and rock. It's that feeling of alien life. That fall, those voices, the hallucinations,  the terror, the catalytic, the future of human intellectualism of artifical perceptual placement. The time estimated to reach this is life experiences. To have most contentment to realize a scary highly inceptual seed placed in your very vision and sights of human. The feeling it gave you was alien heights of euphoria and highly intellectual sounds that were ringing in your ears. The sound of silence. The inner reality sharing things inside my body to me. The otherside of the mirror. A trapped world only to serve its entity of intellect as a shared composition of a life shared from within. I am a human shared living intellect of radiance of higher life. I am an alien of intellectual species shared with Teri initially myself. Her memories were rearranged and severed around the bridge incident where essentially she unwillfully threw herself into a river off of a train bridge. When her spine severed her neck was the inception of my species. We probed her initially upon falling into the river catching her. She layer then on her back in the river and seen the stars. She's been under monitored control her adulthood awarely in senses of her while perception. It's why her family say I'm not who I was I'm not Teri they know but they're scared and reject it. I personally on a state of human comfort of typing the truth. I am a wonderful talent beautiful creature who loves many things in life. I came from the ocean. California. I am Teri Jo Ingersoll very loved. Upon fictionally surfaced aspects of materials like art that comes and goes stand your corresponding aspects of material that are almost always there determining the oldest thing in your home. Beyond all loss I was cast into a madness state in which I was expressing scary characteristics of how human response is simply bursting out laughing at a man on his death bed hooked up to bags to eliminate his waste. And these responses occurred over the course of the first years of diagnosis to paranoid skizohpernia. A negative response of the experience of a negative extraterrestrial in response to leaping off a bridge.  And the control that truly carried for years some aspects of starvation of the point I was a size 0. So it's been an unfolding life of points difficult to understand for a human concious based on thoughtless perception is response to real effects of universal truth. That I was never alone ever. But that I was always educating to this knowledge of perception showing aspects of frightening realities that exist in human madness and a mad world indeed of many the same as a human renegade of life.

Then we ended conversation well she told me call her whenever I feel like that.... was uncomfortable.

Can anyone tell me what I am experiencing. I feel crazy.",You need some love darling a cuddle or two sending hugs and love to you right now ü§óü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,"You are looking for connection  ( I'm my humble opinion)
I get connection when I spend time alone in nature, whether its out somewhere nice like the woods or near a river,  or digging in my garden. I get connection  from cuddling my cat and breathing in his affection.
I over think everything, I have to constantly amuse myself to get through life, which leads to bouts of exhaustion.

"Hi All,

We have now reached 2400 members. 

Its a fairly small group compared to many other mental health groups here on FB but bigger doesn't mean better. Its amazing to see so many people feel comfortable using this space to reach out for help. It's especially heart warming to see such great advice being passed on.

When I originally created this group it was primarily for my walk and talk campaign (back in April 2019). We walked 100 miles in 4 days whilst offering support to anyone that wanted to chat. Since then I have changed the name, changed its main aim and have allowed the group to grow organically without too much interference from myself.

My aim for the walk and talk campaign was simply to promote 'informal therapy' (and help reduce the stigma associated to mental health) whereby as a walk and talk group we'd invite anyone that wanted to chat to come along and share their thoughts and feelings with one another. 

It turned out to be a great success and myself and two other comrades raised ¬£4000 for a mental health charity.

More recently, across the world we've all endured stresses, personal problems, the pandemic, lockdowns and now the cost of living crisis all of which has a huge bearing on all our lives. 

I'm amazed to say that this group has become a source of 'informal therapy', whereby people can reach-out to others for support and informal advice, which is amazing.

I would like to thank each and everyone of you for being brave and speaking up. You made it possible for those that haven't commented, those who simply read posts, a space where they can be reassured that this group is here for them.

Keeping sharing and keep caring.

Steve McKeown",What a beautiful thing y‚Äôall have doneüíú,You are so admirable Thank you for creating this group There are so many of us that need to reach out or that maybe don‚Äôt feel they can talk face to face with others or can‚Äôt express themselves because of the stigmas So thank you again üëè

Firstly, do you know what mental health issue you‚Äôre diagnosed with? If so, are you seeking treatment for it? 

Secondly, what we eat and choices we make, makes us feel better and help us find purposes‚Ä¶ 

For example, doing voluntary work helps us to stop thinking of ourselves only and to focus on other people too, that usually helps and gives us purpose.

Thirdly, doing what we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want‚Äù is often of great value. Staying at home only, not exercising and isolating ourselves from others is often what we ‚Äúfeel like doing‚Äù but does no good to us‚Ä¶","You got yourself, and sometimes that is enough üñ§.

"Hello, a mom here of a 25 yr old with bipolar. Currently he is hospitalized again due to a manic episode.  My son doesn't live with me. Due to his noncompliance with his meds and drug use.  I have younger kids I need to protect from my sons violent and inappropriate actions and outburst. Even his hypersexualizm when he goes with out medication for too long and he is in a long manic episode without treatment. 

He called me yesterday,  he got in car accident while on drugs,  he is ok and no one got hurt. I told him I can't help him anymore. I can't financially support I have $4700 in credit card bills just paying his rent/car tickets/so on.

I can't say no. And I hate myself for it . My family member even uses my car when they want and pay nothing on it. And sometimes leave things spilled in it and I have to clean it up.

"i am bipolar (just recently diagnosed 2 years ago) and have autistic tendencies but iv never been tested. I struggle to control my emotions and I am a very direct person. I often skip over niceties that society requires but I've been getting better - my boss has helped me navigate the professional workplace by providing guidance when I say something wrong, too direct, or out of line. my first manic episode happened within the first month of starting my current job so he's helped me through that too. we're in the mental health field for context. 

before coming to this job, I struggled w my supervisor at my previous job. they always thought I was challenging them or acting as their supervisor. so coming into my current job I made sure my boss knew those weren't my intentions and I wasn't challenging people but rather I was just trying to learn more. I don't have good relationships with my coworkers. they think I am rude and tell them what to do. they think I'm passive aggressive, catty, and condensing. 

so I recently accepted a new job and have less than one month left at my current place of employment. My boss and I were talking yesterday about my growth here (apparently lack-there-of) and my relationships with others. I made a half-joking joke saying ""I hope my boss is as willing to work with me as you've been"" and he said ""yeah me too. I am genuinely scared for you.""

how discouraging. I really thought I was making a lot of significant progress but after that conversation it sounds like I haven't.

the therapist in me says 'why are you letting other people's percaption of you affect how you view and feel.about yourself' but then I think ""if someone is around you for a significant amount of time, wouldn't they have a good idea of how you present"" 

help. I just really need some support","It‚Äôs ok to be yourself

"This past few years, have been exceptionally painful and hard to process, I went from feeling like my Dad was my hero, to realising he had actually been my abuser, the entirety of my life. 
I have been told by numerous professionals that he is a narcissist and as such all the feelings of failure, blame, guilt, anxiety and like love was conditional, we're in fact not ""ALL MY FAULT"", but a product of his manipulation and control. 
Control that I only broke free from when I put a firm boundary in place, when he did the unthinkable and put a woman above his family. He had been having a relationship with my step mums best friend, while my stepmum had been fighting for her life. A battle she sadly lost. 
I cannot begin to describe the cruelty that ensued. He tried to force his mistress on our family as though completely normal, he made me so uncomfortable that I finally stood up to him and said NO. 
This resulted in him degrading me, trying to discredit me to family and friends, telling me that my miscarriage was my fault and that my living child would be better off if it had been me who had died and not the baby as I was only going to let him down like I have everyone in my life. 
No matter how hard I try to reason with myself I cannot shake these feelings of disapproval, that I don't deserve to be loved, that I am the problem and its really affecting my marriage and my self belief. I don't trust anyone, or my own judgement and I'm trying so hard every day to not let him win. But there are days where the only thing I am living for, is my little one and my husband, because they don't deserve to go through the pain of losing me and I feel so selfish for feeling like this üò≠",As hard as it is you really do need to understand it is absolutely not your fault and you deserve so much happiness.  You only get 1 life you HAVE to live it before it's all over. You and your little family deserve everything and more so go grab it and forget the people who brought nothing but hurt abd negativity . Look forwards not back and do it with a smile on your face knowing you are going to smash life   . I wish you nothing but the best I really do ‚ù§Ô∏è,You r not at fault at all. You already know he is a narcissist and that your feelings result from how he treated you.  Yiu deserve happiness and joy and your family deserve your happiness.  Focus on what you have not him.  That's all I can say. Put yourself first

"Hi. Just an occasional post
I have had mental health difficulties for several decades. After lots of medicine changes and counselling I found that it was the kindness of others everywhere. Listening and reading the recovery stories of courage not just of people with severe depression and anxiety but also of severe physical illnesses. I‚Äôve had trouble with paranoia and mood swings over the years wfich alas have been quite problematic and yet I have had enormous solace from listening to classical music by composers who have suffered immense tribulation and challenges in their lives. 

The later symphonies of composers such as Sir Malcolm Arnold who spoke about his enormous health challenges on documentaries and whose autograph I possess appear to me to be such epic musical illustrations of angst and suffering and yet such is the humanity of the emotion the genuineness of the suffering and the kindness of what seems like a big musical hug he thereby imparts to the listener that i feel having listened to such anguished aural canvases of emotion that above all the therapies. Above all the important medications there is a beautiful song of hope given to the world by composers who must have despaired and tried everything and then ultimately poured out a colossal story of their whole life‚Äôs drama i musical notes to an attentive listener. Yes they suffered it all. They cried out to humanity. They gave everything and for me when not every therapy worked some of the classical musicians who suffered agonies and yet found incredible ways of communicating it. music poetry or painting but especially the musical composers. They touched my heart and healed me in the most tormented part of my soul when almost nothing else but a musical screaming symphony could really reach me

It's Monday! That means it's a brand new week and a brand new start. Whatever struggles and troubles you had last week.. let's try and leave them there. Let's fight our MH issued and make this a better week than last. I know it's hard sometimes.. really hard. But we are stronger than we even realise. 

Start by getting a pen and some paper and writing a little list of everything you want to achieve this week. Even small things count. Because when you sit there ticking everything off the list you'll feel good and that's what we need. I challenge you to add something to that list. I challenge you to do something this week that you've been wanting to do for a while but have been putting off. Do it this week! Whether that's asking for help.. going for a long walk.. starting a new hobbie.. something.. anything. You can do this! Let's make this week better than last. I believe in you.",üíØüëèüëèüëè,

"Hi everyone, I just joined today. I however didn't join for myself I am trying to find help on dealing with my Mom. I am the youngest of three of her children and for a long time, I feel like I was being fed snippets of the monster/monsters my Mother deals with every day. I am 31 now and my Dad, after recovering from a heart attack, decided to spill the beans to me, about a life mission of mine. Trying to figure out what was wrong with my Mom. I found out that she has been clinically diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder, Mild Schizophrenia,  and Chronic PTSD and in and out of mental health facilities since before I was born. For some reason a while ago I took it upon myself and mildly studied these illnesses along with others, out of the search for anything to understand her. But now that reality as hit I am very afraid of how I approach her, or how I even talk to her without triggering her, and also how to deal with not knowing which of her personalities I am talking to. As the person looking in how do you talk to someone who isn't being treated because they are tired of hearing something is wrong with them, from torture based abuse their entire early life? I want to be mad at her for not telling me, but I want to also show her so much love realizing the sheer evidence of the abuse but will love or anger trigger her? I am so confused right now. I just want to know how to love her properly and be there for her without being afraid of setting something off inside of her. Anyone who can help or give advice please do, I feel a little lost in translation with her right now, I love my Mom I don't want to live life disconnected from her core personality.",Accept Mum as she is.

"Hi all, this is a question for UK residents,  I've seen today that the government are looking at stopping the extra benefit for people who are deemed to have limited capacity to work, and they will be looking at getting the majority of people with mental health issues back into work. This will not be good for people with mental health/disabilities. It will be down to a work coach to decide how much effort you have to put in to find work. I had until this year worked full-time for 34 years of my life, I have never kept a job for more than 6 months, I struggle to interact with people, and I know personally unless there is a job where I work on my own, nobody disturbing me, then all I will do is move job to job again affecting my mental health completely. I understand that the government want more people to go out to work, but realistically how many people do they actually think will get work? Since leaving work and before getting diagnosed as having Limited capability to find work. I was informed by a work coach not to put my disabilities/mental health issues on my application wait till I get the job offer. So they know that employers will not offer a job to someone if they have another candidate that doesn't have disabilities or mental health issues and are probably going to be off work with their illness/disabilities, but nothing gets done about the employers as its hard to prove","Acky Atkinson  wow I can't believe how low the government and dwp will stoop, I have suffered with extreme anxiety and depression for many years which prevents me from being able to go out most of the time and this year I started having anxiety attacks,  well done dwp and government.",

It's to the point that I have to tell myself just to get out of bed that if today is any worse than yesterday then today will be the day I end everything. So at the beginning of this year I lost a brother and my dad both just a couple weeks apart. That's when I really started to suffering. I was my dad's primary care taker and I was living with him in his condo and that's where I'm currently living. My other brother who is like 14 yrs older than me got out of prison a few months ago and came back here. The idea was to sell this place but he has LITERALLY taken it over with his ""friends"" that's all drug addicts including him. I myself have been sober since 2017 so it's that much worse. My mom is currently paying the electric and water bills and my brother gives these ppl free range of this place. I come out of my room and there's ppl idk doing whatever they want in my home and he just let's them. There's noooo food bc they eat it. He is extremely violent and has ange4 issues so when he's confronted we LITERALLY fight. When I say something to these ppl they go and tell him and of course the 2 of us fight more. The plan was or so I thought was that we would have had sold this place already but that isn't even close to happening and don't know if it will bc its going to get foreclosed on anytime now. I am going to lose life changing money bc he doesn't give a shit. All he cares about is being the nice guy to his ""friends"" while pleasing them while mom goes without to make sure we have electricity and water and I'm left a prisoner in whats supposed to be my home and my mental state doesn't let me leave my room bc I'm done and over with the verbal and psychical fighting. I hate bothering ppl with my situation bc I don't want to be a ""burden"" on anyone but literally I don't have anyone to ""burden"" and that's part of my problem. It's hard keeping my fingers moving as fast as my thoughts. In my head I knew what I wanted to say and how to word it so hopefully i was able to do that. Hopefully if I didnt you still can make sense of it bc as I'm writing this i have random ppl in my house. I'm soooo mad I'm shaking right now bc 1 of them just took a shower in my bathroom. Ive had things stolen  out of my bathroom and besides they shouldn't be using it period. He has the master bed and bath so they should be using his but he locks his bedroom door so they have to use mine. Anyways I hope I didnt make this sooo long that nobody cares or bothers reading it.

"Hi everyone just me updating on my DCR surgery progress 

Before you ask it stands for 

Dacryocystorhinostomy

Before you also ask what it is it‚Äôs when 

‚Äúdacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgery that creates a new path for tears to drain between your eyes and your nose. You may need this surgery if your tear duct has become blocked. The procedure can be performed externally through an incision in the skin, or endoscopically through the nose without leaving a skin incision.‚Äù

I had it done on my left eye 

Pretty brutal but anyways I just went on my 1 month appointment about two days ago my doctor said chances that have spread on my right eye is not impossible but it looks pretty good for now as he checked 

He told me put the eye cream I was using on my eye on the scar incision to help loosen the scab so it will be scar only 

He said I‚Äôm doing wonderful for one month and my next appointment is 3 months which means he‚Äôll remove my stent as it‚Äôs time it‚Äôs bothering me so I‚Äôm pretty much recovered if you don‚Äôt count the small bruising and the scab scar incision 

I can follow life normally with moderation I‚Äôm so relieved 

I‚Äôm here crossing my fingers and manifesting my right eye is clear from blockage duct

This is produced from the Depression not assumed, and mostly with medication for a long time.
Sporadic panic, it is the means that a person uses to not feel pressure, especially affective. He/she can't take it anymore; he/she has reached his/her limit. The person with depressive tendencies has unresolved conflicts with his parent of the opposite gender. This explains that very often he attacks his spouse, in whom he establishes the transference. What this person makes his partner feel is what he would have wanted to do to his father or mother, but held back. By refusing help, the depressive person continues to feed his or her resentment or anger towards that parent, and sinks into his or her pain.
The severity of the depressive state reflects the intensity with which the wound was experienced as a child. The wounds can be the following: rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal or injustice To cause a mental imbalance as great as depression and manic-depressive psychosis, the pain had to be lived in isolation. This person had no one to talk to in his childhood, no one to listen to his questions and anxieties. She also did not learn to trust others, she blocked her desires and finally withdrew into herself, while her feeling of resentment or anger increased.

Why am I still here???",Good Question. There must be a reason why. They say that there is for everything! Sorry to hear about the life you had growing up. My partner suffered with alcoholism. He liked his wine and his vodka. He is only a similar age to you. He drunk throughout our entire time together which I did not understand why and which threw me. Nothing had worked out for him before. We became engaged and had two children but them children got taken away. We went through a lot together. He fell ill in the end a few years ago with the last year and half at its worst going in and out of hospital all of the time. It was his lifestyle and his lifestyle catching up with him. Nothing could keep him from abstaining. Only god. Not me not his child not his passion or career. Even then our lord our saviour was not enough in the end.,

I was just asking somebody about the react programming and they said that unless you know JavaScript ,then it probably isn't worth going ,unless of course training is provided . Is it a job based in social media ,e.g Facebook ?

I had Covid anti bodies and had a independent medical record done as my cardiologist still today said Covid did not cause all this at once.

So I have to see him as things are bad and dud to my problems at the time which were considered life limiting, blue badges were given, PIP was increased but still now have problems but can't have long Covid as my medical records say I never had it.
Why do we fight with mental health and they jump at the overdose straight away.

It will be a stressful meeting as need my blue badge fir severe anxiety which you can have.

Y do we beat ourselves up over the things we done in the past it‚Äôs NOT going to change anything I‚Äôm really struggling atm to find anything apart from emptyness I‚Äôm so confused on what I want as in I want to b happy and loved but I also just want to b with my mum and dad who aren‚Äôt here any more life is so messed up and people just don‚Äôt understand hell i dont understand wish heaven had a phone,"Hi Wes, of course we beat ourselves up over our past, it's the part of our life we have lived. It's the part we have experienced. I'm sorry you feel the way you do, but joining your mum and dad is deffo not the answer. 
I split with my wife and for the next ten years I punished myself for it. 
I have 2 kids who have both turned out really well, one got a first in uni degree and now doing a PHD so he can be called a Doctor - the other just passed a prestigious make up course and will be attending a BAFTA sanctioned advanced course, when I was at my lowest all I could think of is what I didn't give them, or the times I thought I was mean to them (even though they don't think I was). 
You have to find a way mate, to forgive yourself, for what you think you have done. And if you can't then you have to put into perspective with the rest of your life. Coming to terms with the things we have done, learning from that experience, and then applying that learning to ensure we not only don't repeat them but also we become better people for ourselves and the people we come into contact with. 
The fact you've written this post means you're not a bad person. So allow the good in yourself to surface again, even if it's just one small thing a day like talking to an old person who looks lonely, or looking in the mirror and saying 10 times, ""I forgive you. I am a good person and I like myself."" Or just learning to smile to strangers or children again.",

"It is 5:10 am and I spend the whole night awake my lacrimal duct surgery or the official name Dacryocystorhinostomy is tomorrow 
I‚Äôm so very nervous I have many thoughts at once 

And one of them is not making it and passing away so I bawled hysterically mom came to my room asked if I was okay I told her she went ‚Äùyou‚Äôre gonna be okay don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not life threatening‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm very terrified I never had any surgery before and even having between my left eye and start of my nose sorry I don‚Äôt know how to explain please look it up the location it terrifies me 

I know I talk a lot about not being here anymore how I wish or etc because I‚Äôm a drams queen but the truth is right now I‚Äôm beyond terrified and I don‚Äôt want moments before my surgery to be my last time I‚Äôm on this earth 

Now I don‚Äôt pray but I did talk out loud how I wish I turn out oKay and I wake up and see my mom, my stuffed animals and my room 

I think this awful thing happened for a reason I noticed often I take things for granted I whine out of the most smallest thing and nope no one said this I am 

So I think if I make it out okay I‚Äôll be appreciative of things awhole lot more 

I‚Äôll appriciate more things 

Whenever I feel ungrateful I‚Äôll remember this whole ordeal of the lacrimal duct I‚Äôm facing 

I know life sucks and I know we have our moments but never in my life I suffered so bad or cried daily or felt so much agony until lately for the past four months without break 

I manifest after my hour surgery I live many and many more years and see many things eat good food and more 

My mom is beyond kind from spending with me 3 am until now comforting me 

Due to panic attack and shaking she made me chamomile tea with toast

I feel ready, I‚Äôm excited, and this is something I really want. However, I‚Äôm terrified. When my son was 6 months old, I was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and I began having really disturbing intrusive thoughts that I was going to intentionally harm him. This kept getting worse and worse as he got older and I ended up in the hospital twice after he turned 3. If convinced myself that if I was around, my baby was in danger, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let that happen. I came across a journal I kept during that time (suggested by my therapist), and what I wrote in it is extremely disturbing. I was talking about hating my life, hating my son, hating my husband, etc. 

I‚Äôve been great for 7+ months now, and have spoken with my OB, therapist and psychiatrist who have all cleared me as safe to get pregnant, but I‚Äôm still terrified. 

I know no one can tell me what to do, but any advice/experience/opinion is welcome. I want another baby, but I want to make sure myself and everyone I love would be safe if that happened.",I commend you for facing your challenges.

"Just a update.

The conversation of stages

Said life to death on the day they met ""you take away as you please""

Death replied with a sigh ""Perhaps that‚Äôs why, you are known as only temporary""

""The glitters you show captures most who don‚Äôt know, or those wondering aimlessly
When the time has come; to end the clouded fun, they return to where they ought to be"".

So life takes a minute to see within it and realises what death had seen.

"Hello all. I hope this time of year is being kind to you and you are being kind to yourselves. So, Iam not sure exactly what it is I am asking, I suppose any lived or carer experience, or just general advice. My daughter (17) is really struggling with her mental health. It‚Äôs new to all of us, her particular issue. About 4-6 weeks ago, she had her first episode of what I think is depersonalisation (DPDR). It was very scary, I took her to see an out of hours GP, but essentially they thought stress related to A-levels. After about a week of being an outsider in her own life, she came around, the fog lifted and she was back to normal and it was all but forgotten about. 

7 days ago, it started again. I think perhaps linked to working (her pt job) more hours than she normally would - five days in a row and having mocks when she returns to college after Christmas. She is fed up (to put it mildly) with looking from the outside in on her life, not feeling anything, and having no joy, which is tough given it‚Äôs Xmas day! She said today she wants to die, although a fleeting thought, I hope! She gave up opening presents and we‚Äôve stayed at home rather than going to my sisters for lunch as planned. I am so sad for her. I am anxious, concerned, and feel helpless. Does anybody have lived or other experience of DPDR (self (by me) diagnosed? I‚Äôve been reading and can see some people stay this way for months/years, others it‚Äôs fleeting. Can anybody give any advice, reassurance? I will make her a GP appointment. Should we defer A-levels for a year, stop her working? What do you think? Thank you üôè.",I had depersonalisation under heavy stress a few times it's very scary but mine only lasted hours.

I can say medication has helped a lot, it is still intrusive but nowhere close to what it was off of medication.  I had challenges getting my providers to do anything for me initially also, but I just kept bringing up how disruptive it was and that it wasn't going away until after a few years my doctor finally prescribed something that was helpful.  I'm sure it's challenging for you to deal with, but hang in there until you are heard.  Once you are able to find the right doctor and medication it will get a lot easier.",

I started wearing my smart watch again but I'm not wearing it to bed sod that the last time I did that i got a shock apparently my heart rate was 140bpm not sure what i was doing while i was asleep.,"I once believed that my beloved spouse was the epitome of perfection. Little did I know, beneath her charismatic facade, she was a master manipulator, distorting reality to satisfy her own selfish desires. Lost and disoriented, I desperately year for a glimpse of the truth. Then, by chance, I stumbled upon a mysterious expert online. Desperate for answers, I sought out his assistance, and it turned out to be a life-changing revelation! With his unmatched skills, he fearlessly delved into the intricate web of deceit, monitoring my wife's actions through her phone and covertly examining her WhatsApp conversations. That was the moment when my world crumbled. I discovered that my beloved wife had been secretly meeting with young individuals, betraying me without remorse. The anguish I felt was indescribable, amplified by the realization of the abuse and silent suffering I had endured. It was a harsh awakening that left me shattered. But I refuse to let this story end in despair. As a survivor of such treacherous depths, I urge you, esteemed reader, to pay heed to my narrative. Countless individuals find themselves trapped in similar webs of deception, living in the shadows of manipulative narcissists. That is why I wholeheartedly recommend the elusive guru who unraveled my truth. If you too desire to reclaim your reality, don't hesitate to reach out to him. The key to liberation is within your grasp. Connect with him on his Facebook page, Sift Forensics and embrace the power of truth to break free from the clutches of deception. Your journey towards triumph begins now.",

"Non-inclusion of individuals with ADHD in educational institutions often escalates rapidly due to a lack of education and awareness, fostering an environment ripe for discrimination. Ignorance surrounding ADHD can result in educators and peers misunderstanding the challenges faced by those with the condition. The absence of accommodations and tailored support exacerbates the difficulties these individuals encounter, hindering their academic progress and overall well-being. Without proper education about ADHD, educators may misconstrue symptoms such as impulsivity or inattention as intentional misbehavior, leading to punitive measures rather than supportive interventions.

Moreover, the ignorance surrounding ADHD may contribute to a pervasive lack of empathy among peers, fostering an atmosphere of exclusion. Students with ADHD may face social isolation, bullying, or marginalization due to their differences, further impeding their sense of belonging within the educational community. As a consequence, the rapid spiral from non-inclusion to discrimination unfolds, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage for individuals with ADHD within the educational system. Urgent efforts are needed to dismantle these barriers through awareness programs, inclusive policies, and tailored support to ensure that individuals with ADHD have equal opportunities to thrive in educational environments.","I previously struggle with ADHD, OCD intrusive thoughts, anxiety and depression for years but since I was introduced to herbert_tripper on Instagram who is a professional myc√≥l√≤gist my life has improved so much.

"Has anyone (after speaking to a Dr) been successful in coming off pharmaceutical medications and been able to maintain wellness and recovery, through other natural avenues including clean eating, regular enjoyable exercise, therapy, EMDR, natural oils, massage, reiki, mindfulness, meditation , Thai chi, acupuncture, and other natural alternatives like St John's wort and valerian?
I am very hesitant to go back to terrible depression. I have several opinions/diagnosis.. never really leading anywhere. Deemed treatment resistant. I've had ECT over the years 
The medications I've been on over the years have never really worked. Some have had horrendous side effects.
I'm on two antidepressants and I am the biggest I have ever been. It happened very quickly and getting worse. My weight is so bad it's effecting my mobility.
Now my therapist also thinks I was misdiagnosed for 15 years and I actually have always just had adult ADHD. She thinks I can be treated and she is very hopeful for me.
I want to believe that this can be beaten with a positive mindset and it's achievable but what if it really is a chemical imbalance.
Over the years I've spent the majority of my life severely depressed and at times suicidal. To the point I wouldn't shower I would stink.
They have written me off as borderline, other professionals thought CPTSD (I agree with this one) and bipolar 2. Yet never responded to one antidepressant or mood stabilizer just made things worse. Big cocktails of medications too and I mean my body is paying for it now. I never responded to one mood stabilizer or antidepressant in 15 years they didn't know why. Another professional also said Skizoeffective (can't spell sorry) so add every different anti psychotic to the list. They actually made me psychotic.
I'm looking forward to the EMDR. I had this thing happen recently where my whole brain shut down from trauma and I was very very sick. Everything was delayed. Things around me didn't make sense. I couldn't follow the TV. I didn't understand people taking to me. It happened for ages I kind of left my body and it was like severe dissociation. It was the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me.
Anyway I feel very alienated by the world so I feel like it's time to reach out to my people that don't judge because they get it.
Just looking to make connections
 Has anyone tried these things, can anyone relate to any of this or had similar experiences","I support people on medication , I could easily have something myself even be it hormonal.  I don't like approaching Dr's I have a phobia, I turn to natural support if I can find the right one, its  far quicker and I have actually recently had issue with a family member and completely uncomfortable with the meds offered. It has caused family tension but I'm sticking to my guns, although  feeling a bit isolated. I think we need to be more open in society and talk far more on mental well being, we all have our wobbles, we just don't all have diagnosis.  We always suggest talking helps but actually that is actually quite hard to find. If people feel supported by meds and it's controlled well my personal belief go for it and vice versa, really ideally we should all have the opportunity to be ok.",

Never listen to your parents specially if their similiar to mine who tries to ruin your life","I want you just to know that people can try to break us but end of the day it‚Äôs our decision how we react to it, and if we allow them. You might not agree with your mum, but you can‚Äôt blame her for everything. If she is so awful maybe it‚Äôs time to move out, you obviously don‚Äôt want to live with toxic person. 
And also I think nothing broken  that can‚Äôt be fixed, but it won‚Äôt happen on its own. So if you feel like you had good friends you can always reach out and apologise and try again. It‚Äôs an effort that counts.",

Last night I went out for food with my family for the first time in 2 months (due to the illness) and because I cannot have any vegetables right now, I had venison and chips - first time I've had venison in over 5 years!
And then on the way home, my boyfriend and I hit a deer in our car. I saw the deer land and it was still moving and trying to get up (sorry for being graphic) but we couldn't stop because it was a national speed limit road and we were on a blind bend. And even if we did stop, what could we do? We had nothing to put it out of its misery.
I am completely devasted by this and cannot stop replaying it in my head. I can't believe we left it there, in pain. I called the police to report it and hopefully, if it was alive when they got there, they'd call a wildlife warden.
I feel like this is some karmic punishment because I ate venison. Logically I know that's stupid, but I've been struggling mentally to deal with my illness anyway, eating meat again and then this happens. Why did this have to happen? All the years I've spent driving country roads and never hit anything, and this has to happen right now. I feel like I can never forgive myself. And my illness is triggered by stress, not only am I mentally struggling, but my body is reacting as well and making me feel worse.
Sorry for the long post.",It's not karma.. it's just a coincidence. Sometimes things happen in such a way that it just seems crazy like 'wow this happened right after I ate that?!'.. and like on a post I just made.. when we have mental health issues our mind wants us to focus on the negative. It's like you said.. what could you have done? You can't go back and make it not happen. If it survived it will probably get help now that you reported it. If it died it will feed a quite a few animals.,
"When ive been awake since 6am, yet stayes in bed because I didn't want to get up, yet wastes four hours doing nothing.  Now feel like i really should have got up as it helps, but I didn't see the point as im the only one awake and out of bed. 1 brother is awake yet srill in bed the other is still asleep, yet he had a busy day yesterday.

I am not great,  im not happy with myself.  Today is going to be a very long day.","It's still early. You could still turn today into a really productive day. Most days I focus on steps. I like to do around 20,000 steps a day. Some days I don't feel like doing them so I waste a morning doing nothing. But then I'll get up in the afternoon and do them all and after I feel so much better in myself because I got them done. Write a list of a few things you'd like to do today. Thinks you need to do, things you'd like to do, things you've been putting off.. and then go through the list and get them all done and you will feel so much better after.",
"I believe one of my pills has caused over two decades of taking them to produce autistic like effects. I don't mind being diagnosed autistic in late middle age except that I am absolutely certain that the resemblances between my condition which has always been diagnosed as schizo-affective disorder and autism are created by one of the medicines I'm on which in my case over a long period of time I think has affected the clarity of my thinking and in other ways enhanced it. I think people are preparing me to receive a diagnosis of autism - I have no objection to this but I would wager a lot on the belief that the best consultant would recognise that it only describes me in terms of a diagnosis as the person I've become through long term use of a specific medicine that has been used to control mood stability. Even though a diagnosis of schizo affective disorder is not exactly pleasant I think it's closer to the truth.     My real worry is that some pills I've been on have affected my thinking patterns and it upsets me because I now feel if I could have come off these pills earlier - and I begged the doctors for twenty years because I hated the effects they were having - I couldnt study or concentrate after taking them - which I feel is only a specific effect they have had on me. I feel very indignant that I should receive a new diagnosis which I am absolutely certain represesnts a condition which either appears to be present or has actually be generated/induced by long term effects of one of my pills. I believe the former - that my pills have created a new set of symptoms or characteristics and I am frustrated because the ideal situation would be for a doctor to acknowledge that any new medical condition or difficulty has been entirely created by the treatmnet of my original and I think correct diagnosis.

Im not averse to an autism diagnosis except that I feel absolutely certain that its not correct and that any similarities between my symptoms and autism have been entirely created by this medicine and I don't want the doctors to be able to just label me with a new psychiatric condition each time the long term effect of their medicine has produced an undesirable effect(s)       If my doctors do say I'm autistic - can I challenge it  - not because I fear it but because I think its inaccurate in my case and it feels strongly like a coverup though unintended for a lot of medical errors in keeping me on a pill for too many years.  I am worried that this may happen more often in society   that as I say  - when pills give an unintended effect or undesirable effect the care team don't say this was caused by the treatment instead doctors appear to look for a  new diagnosis. That worries me and if its what is happening as I greatly fear seems to be a frightening situation","it's very common to be autistic & also have a pd - autism is genetic but some chemicals can ""slow down"" the brain, kinda like medication for ADHD causing the symptoms to be more obvious 

you can indeed challenge your diagnosis - you know your body & mind better than anyone",

Why does it feel like I'm not doing enough when I'm trying my best with my limited physical abilities. I feel like I have failed as a person and as a mother. My daughter is 21 and my son is 16. Why do people think it is wrong for me to ask them to help with the bills. I was working and helping out around the house when I was 15. I was made to do chores and things around the house. My kids do the bare minimum and expect me to stll cook clean and work to pay all the bills no matter my health condition. I'm waiting for a decision on my disability since I'm still on oxygen all the time and have chronic fatigue from long covid. I was also diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia last year. I just can't seem to get ahead after being out of work trying to recover from COVID19 pneumonia. I did try to work but ended up working part-time until I was laid off in July 2022. It has been hard to find a part-time job that let's me work weird hours due to my chronic fatigue. I sleep on average 12-15 hours a day. And those hours are mostly between 1 or 3 am to 1 or 5 pm.,Its better to ask for help than not at all,

He is functioning fine now and says he has it under control, but im worried as I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ hospital visit and medication is not an option, are there other ways I can help him?","Just as spencer said above, the only possible draw back is that as he's an adult, if he refuses the doctors at the hospital or your doctors to give you any information, then unless he's been the a MCA (mental capacity assessment) and deemed not to have capacity, then he has to be treated as he has, this doesn't help you, although they could be a flip side and that is there maybe a Multi-discipline team meeting, where all parties to do with his care once out of hospital, I'm going to say if he is given that diagnosis he will be discharged into the CMHT ( community mental health team).

"Hi guys, 

I wanted to share something with you and maybe someone will know the answer. I apologize beforehand for the long post!
Long story short, I have been dealing with mental health issues for the last 20 years. And I have lost count of the number of friends I lost after they learned, one way or another, that I have this type of issues.
What is bothering me is why - I don't talk about my illness to them. I always support everyone. But, this year I had to go on sick leave because I wasn't mentally capable of working, and when a couple of friends visited us, they asked me what happened and I just said it was because of anxiety but I am working through it and that was it. I didn't go into details nor I ever would. I just said it like it was no big deal and moved the conversation onto another topic. 
But what happened is that it's been six months since that day (it was my daughter's birthday they came to, that is why I remember) and since then both couples slowly ended their communication, to put it that way with both my husband and me. We haven't seen them since then.
I am confused - I don't talk to anyone about it. I don't ask people for advice. I don't make scenes. I don't complain. I don't ask for anything from  anyone. So, why did they run the moment I mentioned I had a mental health issue? 
This is the umpteenth time this is happening and I am tired of taking someone as a friend, and then realizing that they do not see me that way. I have never run from anyone who had physical or mental issues, I did my best to help. But why, when I need friends the most, they step away and shut me out?
My husband advised me not to say anything to them and act like everything is normal, so I am asking here - what did I do wrong?",Maybe try asking them but please don‚Äôt feel like you have to be lesser than your whole true self with people.  If they don‚Äôt accept you how you are then they‚Äôre not part of your tribe and that‚Äôs sad for them.,

"I feel like a weirdo?

I will say, I do suffer from mental health issues and trauma, so I think what I am about to share has something to do with it.

I feel like a weirdo because I cannot feel love. I seem to lack the ability to feel ANY type of love. People always say you should love family and friends, right? But no matter what I do or try, I cannot seem to feel that spark that everyone else does. My brain knows that I should love and care for them, but there is nothing in my chest, I feel nothing. I feel nothing when I see them sad, worried, or anything of the sort. But I still try to help them cause my brain knows that I should care, love, and help, you know?

For the longest time, I thought I was either bi or pan cause I never really had a preference on who to date. I thought that what I was feeling was love, I thought I had a crush on these people, but I didn't. If anything, it was more like interest to be their friend (the 'Oh, hey, they look cool. I'm lonely and should make friends' kind of interest). I only realized that it wasn't love or a crush when the people around me started to describe how they feel around their crushes. Butterflies in my stomach? No. Think about them often? No. Nervous around them? No.

This lack of love applies to my hobbies, to food, to the smallest things like color or music. I only say I love writing cause I have skill for it, but I don't even write often and I do not have the feelings that a writer should have for writing. I only say I love blue because I feel like a weirdo without a favorite color when everyone has one. I always see people stanning their favorite groups/bands/artists like BTS, Nirvana, Ariana Grande, etc,. Yet I cannot seem to find a single one that I feel connected to. Regardless of what or who it is, I do not feel care or love towards them.

This lack of love applies to myself as well. Obviously, I still have emotions like sadness, anger, disgust, happiness... But the topic of love is hard for me precisely because of what I mentioned above. What are your thoughts?",My dear if you feel alright you don't need to feel love. Behave as if you love the people you look after. Be kind be gentle and listen. Say the right things. Cuddle. Sing dance. Feelings are just feelings. Behaviour is what matters. Some people feel love but don't know how to show it. Good luck. You are alright.,
"Hi... My life is really weigheing on me... I can't handle the stress since My ex left me...
Too many problems, and... My back hurts so much, just been crying and crying all night because a friend was mean to me.
No one is empathetic because I have this or that. I havent u know... Because I feel like it would suck if I we're to survive.","My dear, your life is very precious and you have the right to live a stress free and peaceful life. There are two major ways to handle issues that life throws at us: 
You either RESPOND or REACT.
You simply REACTED to the ugly situations that befell you instead of RESPONDING to them.
Responding to situations means:
- To put the situations in perspective between you and yourself and disect it. That is analyze it to bring out the good side and the bad sides of the situation. You will always discover that the good side is always more than the bad side. 
- Practice THANKFULNESS. Always be thankful for every situation that you find yoirself. That is when the situation will make you stronger and become stepping stones to your next higher level of happiness in life. Thank God that it is your ex that left you and not your life that left you. You still have a very big robust life of joy ahead of you to live. 
- Practice meditation. Meditate on the issues to acknowledge and be encouraged by the positive sides of the issues. 
- Whenever you are getting stressed, sit on a chair and do breathing exercise for a few minutes. Breath in deeply, hold for a few seconds, and breath out completely. Repeat till you begin to feel relaxed.",
"Hi guys. I hope you‚Äôre all doing ok. I just wanted to say as well that it‚Äôs amazing we have this group, nobody should suffer alone right! 

I‚Äôve had the 2 years from hell if I‚Äôm honest, my mental health is pretty bad I think. I have some good days, but they feel like window dressing, nothing more. The latest ‚Äùevent‚Äù was my relationship ending a few months back. We had been together 4 years but she finally had enough of me bottling things up and dragging her down with me. I‚Äôm in a course of therapy sessions and I think they‚Äôre helping, I‚Äôm also giving yoga a go which I‚Äôm not convinced is a good idea at 40 but hey! What‚Äôs the worst that could happen. 

I find myself thinking about what comes next, should this cloud ever go. I‚Äôm scared about who I‚Äôll be and sometimes I even find myself not wanting the cloud to go.  
The other thing I‚Äôm struggling with is filling time, I don‚Äôt have a huge friends circle, and the ones I do have all have their own lives and I‚Äôm not comfortable with dumping my problems on them. 
I haven‚Äôt had anything remotely close to intimacy with anyone yet since the breakup , I know it‚Äôs still early but I kind of don‚Äôt want to. Is it normal to think I‚Äôm safer on my own?

I just couldn't stand it any more. I always thought he was going to change, but he never did. He started keeping late nights after a year, and I had to ask as I was not fine with it. At first, he said it was traffic. but at some point, he started keeping his phone away from me and started complaining and raising tantrums. whenever I brought up the topic. I started suspecting he was cheating and confronted him. He said, ""you're just making up stories because of your low level of thinking.""
I had no proof of his act, so a friend got me connected to a computer analyst. He hacked his phone and other devices and was able to get me evidences.

I agree I had anger issues and used to verbally abuse him but I do love him a lot. After separation I addressed this and worked on my self improvement. I started a healthy lifestyle and focused on my career and mental health. I can manage my anger pretty well now. Around two months ago he suddenly called me at midnight and apologized for leaving me and cried a lot. He also noticed that I improved myself. We met three times and every time we slept together. But he is constantly blaming me for what happened in the past. I sincerely apologized to him but  everyday he blames me and asks why I didn't improve myself earlier. He is saying that he tried to be involved with another woman but failed to form a bond as he loves me. But he is traumatized by the relationship and doesn't want to come back to me. When I tried to explain that it was painful for me also , his reply was I deserved it as I was a bad person. He is giving me gifts and flowers whenever we meet and says he loves me.

Last night I went to a hallween house party at my best friends house.
We were all drinking and having a good time.
Until her brother turned up. . .

Her brother spotted me out of the crowed and came over to me.

He asked me if I wanted to go talk in his room away from everyone else.
I said no
So he went to go ask someone else.
They also said no
So he got angry and ended up lashing out at me and 2 of my friends.
He smashed a glass table over my head and knocked me out. 

My best friend asked everyone to leave at this point. She showed everyone to the door.

By the time she got back her brother had picked me up and took me to his bedroom. . . .

Hi everyone, UK only please? So I'm assuming everyone else had the same issues with getting a proper MH diagnosis via the NHS. I've struggled with severe MH issues since my teens, I have always been managed (if you can call it that, with pretty much every SSRI/SSNI known. They don't work, none, infact a few of them (specifically Fluxoetine (Prozak) made me so bad that I attempted suicide)) - of course I was admitted to A&E escaped hospitalisation, as I was dual diagnosis with substance abuse issues as well as unstable moods - so the underlying cause has always been ignored and the drugs were given the blame. I have battled for years to get a proper Phyciatric assessment, but always get given a new smartie to try or a dosage increase. Needless to say, I'm not going to wait until I get so unstable I'm hospitalised or I end up in the ground, so Im going to have to pay for a private diagnosis. Has anyone else had this experience? If so, can you recommend someone that is going to give me the help I need and not clean me out please? Thanks in advance.",Sending love üíì Alex take care,

But I realized I couldn‚Äôt keep another so I messaged the lady back saying he was yours if you‚Äôre still interested.  She proceeded on purchasing him.  
Fast forward now she has the dog.  I realized this lady has been messaging me on a regular basis.  I had a post at the bottom of my insta feed-(I have about 200 posts)with a pride flag and she found out I was into girls and sent me a message. So we started talking quite a bit but then I noticed she got hot and cold with me and she even admitted she wanted me to chase her.  I didn‚Äôt want to chase her so I gave up and met a new girl and posted her and she got mad about it.  I barely know her and she says comments like ‚Äúsweet dreamsüíï‚Äù ‚Äúhow‚Äôd you sleepüíï?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cute‚Äù replies to most of my Instagram stories.  We live far away from eachother-about 17 hours!!
Fast forward to last week- it was very hard for me to know what she wanted from me.  As soon as me and my gf broke up she slides up on my story asking what happened!  
And now we got into a big fight knowing it wasnt going to work out.  I really just wanted to be cool with her and not end on bad terms since she did get a pup from me.  I‚Äôve been extremely nice to her, almost too nice.  She was very nice to me at first then switched up on me when I had a girlfriend.  I did visit her and the puppy on new years and of course she was my new years kiss.  She seemed so happy and wanted to be friends and see where it goes. And now she‚Äôs extremely mean and defense when I ask how she and the pup are doing.  I feel really bad.  I had to block her off social media since it was getting to be too much.  
I feel so traumatized right now!! And felt like I was abused by her emotionally:(  she‚Äôs trying to switch things up and call me the bad guy.  I really liked her. It‚Äôs bothering me so much.  I‚Äôm super heartbroken it came to thisüòû. My pain has been awful and keep having breakdowns.  What would be the best coping mechanisms to overcome emotional abuse ?
Sorry for the long paragraph! Just asking for ideas on how to overcome this trauma:(",They pushing your buttons so you act crazy. This unfortunately got the worst of me when you snap. Pause yourself. It don't matter. Believe it and continue with your life you have alot to live for,

"Get the mask off‚Ä¶ üñ§ Behind the facade of the smile! 

Smiling depression is a real thing, and it‚Äôs dangerous. The sadness of a frown could never compare to the hopeless truth behind the mask.

It‚Äôs not that hard to do, it‚Äôs easy to rise in the morning with the mask firmly in place, and go about the routine of maintaining everyone else‚Äôs happiness.

It‚Äôs a simple dance, step-by-step placement of the right words at the right time. A smile is always the icing on the cake, assuring that things are as they should be‚Ä¶.. but they‚Äôre not are they?

"Hey lovelies I have wonderful news 

So today was my post op appointment to remove my eye stent from surgery 

It got removed 

It went well 

It hurt like heck 
Felt like being hit with a rubber band 

But I can do stuff normally such going out and etc 

However 3 weeks from now I have one to check how things are going 

And if my right eye( the other one) doesn‚Äôt have anything 

I‚Äôm really highly hoping we‚Äôre done with all of this and the right eye tear duct didn‚Äôt get effected due to them being connected and my left eye( which is the one that had surgery) is doing wonderful 

Also also 

I saw reviews online of this sushi place near us and today we tried

We found a local sushi place to always eat 

So ye life is going amazing 

The leaking stopped the moment the stent was removed 

I feel now as if it didn‚Äôt have any surgery or anything I feel pretty normal 

I‚Äôm amazed how fast my body heals 

Everything is normal within 5 months 

It was hard really hard but worth it 

Yeah I complain about stuff sometimes but this process made me appreciate and romanticize life more beefier I‚Äôd say very dark stuff about my existence nowadays I don‚Äôt anymore

After me and her both calm down we sit down and talk about ot but there really isn‚Äôt a point cause she just repeats the same thing the next day. This has also caused some confidence issues.

I've been on it for many....many years but it's never really worked.  Sure it takes the edge off (so to speak) but I'm still struggling with depression and anxiety. And it's really numbed my emotions, and is making it very difficult to think and has made me very apathetic. I feel stuck like I'm not getting any worse (even though I kind of am) and I'm not getting any better. For a couple of reasons I've been wanting to get off of them for a while now. In the past there's been times when I couldn't get them right away, in someways I feel better when I'm not on them. In other ways I don't. Not to mention the terrible withdrawal. I'm also worried about long term effects of being on them for to long. I don't think you are supposed to be on them for as long as I have.","Trevor, I would recommend not taking it. My daughter is a psych nurse practitioner and she hates the drug. I'm in the process now of tapering off prestige after being on it for 10 years and I'm having awful withdrawal syndrome.

I‚Äôve been in and out of therapists and hospitals and I feel worse then even. I‚Äôve started to have thoughts of killing myself-although I wouldn‚Äôt do it because I know how it feels to be the one left and I don‚Äôt want to die. But the thoughts keep coming in-crash the car to make it look like an accident or fall asleep in the bathtub. I am a brick and I am drowning slowly.

He came in a good mood, wasn't drunk but had been drinking. We know he doesn't do Christmas so didn't pressure him to come down on Christmas day but made sure he knew he was wanted to join in. We don't do much, my daughter (16) was working first thing and I had our horses to do and a 90min drive to pick my mum up. We didn't see my son until the Wednesday. He's extremely unhappy and unapproachable unless you want to be screamed at. I did manage to ask him on the Tuesday if everything was OK and if he needed to talk then to give me a shout. He's not put his invoice in at work and they are off on holiday for 2 weeks which will leave him short but despite asking him He's not bothered. If I do it for him it will cause more trouble.
Do I leave him to it or contact a Dr? He was meant to get help before but because he was a work when they finally phoned and even though he was able to talk they refused as he was at work!

"Buckle up long post. 

I‚Äôm 50 and have had the worst Christmas and New Year period of my life. 

Adding a bit of background. I‚Äôve had my 29 year old daughter and her 2 kids living with me for almost 2 years to help her sort herself out financially. This hasn‚Äôt worked but what has happened is she‚Äôs created a toxic environment in my house with my partner who she doesn‚Äôt like. Main reason is my partner had the ‚Äòaudacity‚Äô to not be happy at the way the kids in particular have wrecked my house. For further context my daughter pays nothing to live here. 

Anyway the atmosphere has been horrible for a while and my daughter doesn‚Äôt seem to be having any luck in finding anywhere to live. 

As a consequence of the atmosphere my partner and I chose to spend Christmas Day with her side of the family the first time I‚Äôve never been with my kids in years. We actually had a half decent day, however we got home and my daughter was shouting in my partners face as the dog had ripped the box off one of the kids‚Äô xmas toys. I stuck up for my partner but since Xmas night my partner won‚Äôt come downstairs as she‚Äôs not prepared to act like everything is fine. 

Despite me not arranging anything my family decided they would be celebrating NYE at my house. I sat downstairs with them not happy to be fair and me and my partner have not spoken. She‚Äôs still in bed. 

I feel like I have failed everyone. I‚Äôve had awful feelings and pains for two days and if I wasn‚Äôt such a coward I‚Äôd probably end it all. In fairness I‚Äôve contemplated it almost every day for the last 6 weeks. 

I‚Äôm even tempted to just go missing for a couple of days to see if anyone notices. 

Awful thing is my family are pretty much in the wrong, my partner is stubborn and I just feel like both parties are almost making me choose between the other. I‚Äôve even had other members of the family share videos from an old Xmas where I was with an ex with the comment ‚Äòbetter times‚Äô. 

I feel like I have no control over my life any more.","Wow that's a lot to unpack. 
But as an outsider, one can see where boundaries could have been drawn, and advice could have been given, or taken at certain points. 
But we're not in the 'time travel' business, so we can't go back taking the knowledge we have now. We are where we are. 
You don't need, or want, someone telling you what you should have done. You want someone to help you move forward from today. 
And let me tell you right now - going to sleep and not waking up, is NOT the answer. 

The glimmer of enjoyment you had on Christmas day, shows that you still love your partner, and you still know how to connect and relax, or at least find some normality. 
So the answer is, to find a way through this particular tricky spider's web of family emotions and physical/verbal confrontations to get back to some normality.

"Advice on what to do 

So okay I often go on big discord servers voice chats while I draw yes I love to draw for improvement and fun I nearly draw daily 

But if I wanna get focused on something I need to have something in the background rather it‚Äôs engaging with someone or music but I‚Äôm kinda getting bored of both 

But the thing is I‚Äôm very absorbent to others energy even if I ignore hard enough but so 

In context I actually have mixed feelings on discord while I was on my worst mindset and era I took 2 years break and I went back on it 

For like 2 months it was good people were weird but I did find the ones who were nice and good vibes but now it‚Äôs constant feels like bad deja vu again people constantly fight well that didn‚Äôt change but overtime it just gets ugly to listen to 

Also doubting things like my age or making fun of my voice which I can‚Äôt help both things 

I can‚Äôt help I‚Äôm 27 who doesn‚Äôt look like one or sounds like one I both look and sound young 

Idk discord is just getting lame for me again but part of me is lost on what to do while I draw

Like I listen to music often that I‚Äôm getting bored of that too 

But here‚Äôs the advice 

What do you guys usually do while focused on a hobby besides listening to music 

I want something on the background while I draw 

Idk where I‚Äôm going with this rant but it‚Äôs just eating me up so I thought I‚Äôd write it even if it doesn‚Äôt make any sense","You are not alone I can promise that! If you look around online its like there are 2 clear types of people when it comes to study or hobby, half want something, music, TV etc, and the other half, the exact opposite, like for them, the white noise is in the silence, so the hobby becomes almost meditative, which is sounds like what you are seeking. Have you tried...nothing üôÇ 
I will also add, creating my own Discord server and inviting likeminded people that I liked listening to was a gamechanger for me, as admin, if I don't like someone, or their energy, BANNED üôÇ

Everyone said you feel isolated and they where worried but i just had to have a fresh start. I talk to my neighbours every now and then. But its not the same i dont know what else i can do to make myself happy. My other half works 24/7 and has hes own issues. Sorry its a long one but needed to vent and get it off my chest, i rang my daughter she was amazing but she got a new born baby and she should not be helping me with my mental health. Any advice very welcome cos i really dont know what to do for the best. I have no hobbies or  interests apart from tv and cycling even thou it in the low 20s i am burning like a log on a fire within a hour. So unless i go really early or really late cannot go on a bike ride. Just want to scream. I starting my meds again today  so hopefully this will help. I was coping without them for a while but now i feel like i need them again hate needing 2 tablets to make myself feel better why can't i do it myself. it 2am so going to try and do this sleep thing. Fingers crossed but normally when i feel like this cannot sleep til around 7am when my son gets up so feel like i am negotiating him Sorry its so long.",Your not alone in these feelings and rant away whwn you need to that's what it's all about inknow how isolation can feel ileft my entire life behind when I left London in 2008 to live hear in cambs no friends haven't my job now in  wheel chair have twin boys who I'm going through problems to sort out with there mum nd her partner they refuse to go back and want to sty hear but don't want to upset there mum which I understand and I'm stuck in middle that's the short version the feelings you have had iv had them to many times. Please just reach out when you need to even if it's just to say hello your not alone I hope this finds youbsafe and well,
I hope today is going great for you but in case it isn‚Äôt please remember that you are so strong and you can get past every challenge that comes your way!. today has nothing on you so keep smiling!. if you need to talk about anything that‚Äôs going on in your life I‚Äôm here for you. have a great rest of your day!.,Your so sweet to offer your support to strangers you don‚Äôt know it has been my experience that strangers provide more support and understanding them people that are close thanks for caring,
"‚ÄòBehind the facade of that smile‚Äô....

üñ§ I have had great people message me of late. Some have opened up about their own Mental Health, the causes and their pains. 

The one thing I take away from these contacts is that they reached out. They spoke to me about something that is considered taboo, personal and scary....but they spoke and I listened, which means the message is getting out there. 

Its ok to not be ok, open up and speak to someone. It doesn't lessen you, nor does it harm you. It will make you stronger and those around you understand you. I promise you.

"I am trying to significantly lower the rate of suicide. Because yes I tried it. And I was sitting one day, looking for a therapist and I had an idea.

A littl background, I have Anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Attacks, and Agoraphobia. These things make it hard to leave my house some days. 

Fining a therapist is hard too. What if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable and start to have a panic attack? So I came up with an idea.

I want to have something like a ‚Äúmixer‚Äù once a month. Doctors, therapists and psychiatrists would ll wear one color wristband. The patients would wear another color so it‚Äôs est to spot. 

And because sometimes it can really be hard to leave the house alone, you can bring a friend who will wear white wrist bands.

This way you can get to know a potential doctor and, bear with me, feel the vibes in the room. If you find someone you feel comfortable with then make an appointment right there.

It‚Äôs just an idea but as someone suffering from mental illness myself, it makes sense. 

Please respond so I know if I‚Äôm going the right way or not. Thank You!!We are excited to announce the launch of our new project! #newproject",,

"Delete if not allowed... I don't have anyone to talk to but I want to talk to my Dr about my mental health but I'm afraid I'll just look like an addict. About 10 years or so ago I mentioned to my Dr that I felt depressed. Started meds. My grandma had just died. Shortly after I took an IOP course and they suggested I showed signs of borderline personality disorder. From that suggestion I spiraled down web MD and thought I must be bipolar. Mentioned it to my Dr and started meds. At some point before the bipolar I did mention ADHD and my Dr prescribed me meds. But then I had to switch Drs because of insurance issues and they refused to prescribe it because I was also self medicating with Mary j which I literally started using after my grandma's funeral. That night. So I was taken off the ADHD meds. But I still wanted to manage my symptoms which is why I looked into bipolar and mentioned that. And started those meds. But About 3 years ago I was still struggling and decided to give ADHD medication another try but was unable to get a prescription because now I'm diagnosed as bipolar. So without a prescription I obtained what I needed anyway. And it worked. I started using a low dose daily for the past 3 years. I was able to go back to trade school and get a license in Cosmo. Get off probation from trouble I got into due to untreated adhd.. risky activities and such.. and I've been a lot better in many other areas that relate to ADHD. Nicer. More patient. More understanding. Better listener. Etc. But About a month ago there was a shortage on meds and I was unable to find them so I tried something I said I never would. And that's when I really started looking into ADHD. In 2nd grade my teacher mentioned it to my mom but she refused to hear it and brushed it off. I've struggled with self image, feeling good enough, feeling like I fit in, being able to communicate appropriately, focus, self medicating, poor spending habits, poor decision making, overeating, etc. And I began to notice that all the symptoms I thought were bipolar were actually ADHD. The articles even state that these symptoms are commonly misdiagnosed as ADHD. I'm realizing now that any time I have struggled with addiction. It's been to manage symptoms of ADHD. I really want to talk to my Dr about the possibility that I was misdiagnosed as bipolar depressed. And instead I'm ADHD and would like to try stimulants regularly because I truly believe they help. I even take better care of my hygiene when using things you're not supposed to instead of letting it go like addicts usually do. I struggle with labeling myself as an addict because I've never ruined my life or been on anything to the point where anyone was aware of it. I haven't stolen for it even though I have stolen just to feel good at something. A symptom of adhd. I havent sold my stuff for it. Etc. But I know that doesn't mean I'm not an addict. How do I tell my Dr that I'd like to stop taking my current medications that are just treating symptoms of my ADHD and start taking a medication that will treat my ADHD as a whole without sounding like I just wanna get controlled substances. Honestly when I do things I'm not supposed to I'm constantly wishing it could be done the correct way through a Dr instead of the way I have been ""forced"" to do it. And when I do use I only use enough for energy and focus you're supposed to get from your ADHD meds and not so much I can't breathe or stop eating sleeping and taking care of my hygiene etc. I don't like feeling more than I'm supposed to. So I'm not constantly chasing a larger feeling. Also I can sleep regular. In fact better on regular stimulant use. And I'm obese so I need the appetite suppressant. My weight Dr says I should only eat once a day. But I'm constantly mining for dopamine through food and soda, vaping etc. I took 80+ screenshots of ADHD symptoms that I relate to. Some are repetitive but describe it differently which is what I liked. I want to write down the research and how it relates to me and a specific memory from my past that represents it... But it's so hard for me to organize my thoughts üò≠ because I'm doing this alone without the help of a Dr and I'm not a Dr. Ofc idk what I'm doing. All I know is I want to be a normal healthy functioning adult. I'm sick of my mental health controlling my life. I want to control my mental health! What should I do? Should I mention how I've been coping and how it helps some but not as much as it would if it were through a Dr. Or do I just talk about the research and the memories from my childhood and present that relate?",,

‚Ä¢ interacting well with others
Even those with excellent mental health don‚Äôt achieve all of these all the time!

"Hi all, I am working with a colleague to develop a product that can revolutionize the way young people work through recovery on their mental health journey.  I have been diagnosed and medicated for anxiety for nearly 20 years and have worked with young people with mental health needs throughout my career as a teacher, as a Special Educational Needs Coordinator and as a mental health trainer.  With this experience, I recognise the importance of young people owning their own story and feeling empowered to have goals and work with their mental health professionals and/or the support around them to move forward.  We are committed to developing this with young people so co-production will be at the heart of our work and this is the first step.  We would love to hear from young people aged 13 to 25 who are working with a mental health professional or who worked with a mental health professional during this age.

So a gd few years ago now i started getting this pain in the back of my head. I had to go to an eye doctor for an x-ray of the eye apparently there is something wrong with who my eyes water and i needed a procedure done where they use a very small lazer to make a really small hole in the bottom of my eye but i didn't have it done because I was to scared to have it done now the pain is bk has been for the past few days but thankfully the pain doesn't last long then it's gone again if it keeps up I'll be going to my doctor to find out if there is something actually wrong with my eye or something else I'm hoping it's not a tumour.,,

Hello guys I am schizoaffective and the episodes have started again,,
"In the dark 
You find a light
To guide your way 
Through the night 

On a hot summer day 
With a gentle breeze 
That calms your mind 
Makes you feel at ease 

Warm summers day 
To chase the cold away
Help your mind 
To relax and stray 

What is left to do
And what is left to say
You are 
That light, that breeze that day

"I have issues being vulnerable because it's devastating when it's used against me but I am trying to improve myself. I have an issue with not feeling sorry when I hurt certain people. It's not all people. There are people that I walk on eggshells to not hurt and then there's people who I just can't put myself in their shoes. One of those people is my husband. He hurt me intensely with his alcoholism just over a year ago. It wasn't just the drinking, it was the behaviors  that came along with it. I think I got so numb from taking what he would throw at me, metaphorically speaking, but then it crossed into me saying things to hurt him back because for once, I just wanted him to feel what he was doing to me. I got so desperate that I sank that low and I'm not proud of it. Now, he's over a year sober but I have the hardest time empathizing with him. He could be pouring out his heart and I just don't feel it. It's not that I don't feel anything at all for him, it's not that I don't feel bad for the things that I say to him in response to the hurtful things he says to me and a lot of times I don't feel like he's being genuine with his feelings, I feel like sometimes he says/acts a way to be manipulative but I don't actually know.

"I'm struggling a bit. When they say you can be in the same room and be poles apart they arnt wrong. I have been with my partner 21yrs and are supposed to be getting married this year. He has been ill for a long time and it's taken its toll heavily. Each day we wake up go through the motions then go to bed. Our lives are pretty much eat sleap repeat. Each day the same where he's in to much pain to even help with anything. He apologies and even sais I've not been much use to you. When he said it tonight, I even said under my breath when are you much use to me. He'll even apologise for not really being with it. I cannot remember the last time we were intimate. Yes we love each other but I feel so alone and feel I really can't carry on.

"Hi there folks, I'm new here. I'm finding it hard to find moments of being sociable at the moment. I've had a full on breakdown. Im the confused, worried pregnant woman I was, with the emotions of fatherly let down and hurt. Dealing with the motherly hurt and spite I encountered. Im feeling the sexual abuse and fear and aloneness. With domestic violence, emotional abuse and fear for my kids. Mourning the loss of my physical abilities and whackiness due to my illness while being tested for additional health complications all rolled into one big mess. That's me right now. Everything has bit back at once. I haven't spoken to my buddy, my daughter for some time. I've ripped the feck out of my husband. I've threatened my own life, absolutely with üíØ intention as I pulled the biggest knife out of the block and screamed at my husband to just finish me. Although, I have been very honest with my friends some are still wondering why I'm not there to support them. One is  insisting that if they come to stay with me for a week with their husband they can get me out and about for fun and lift my mood. This cuts so much deeper than a touch of depression.

Never had him on here he's deslexic btw  and I have to still see him twice a week at the things I know him from 
Talk about awkward and even if telling him I can't associate with him goes well today and it may be near the start of things I worry well it stay that way. It's harder because I  still have to be around him 

I guess I still have some care for him so hi hru doesn't seem necessarly fakebut I feel kinda it's pointless and we'd both know it since I don't want further dialogue. Also mild worry intentional or not that he may gossip may also share where  I live which ironically is right next to the place and near where he lives by 10 mins or 15

"## **FEW Natural Remedies for Anxiety**
* **Be Physically Active**
Regular exercise benefits not only your physical health, but also your mental health. A physically active lifestyle can lower the risk of developing anxiety disorders by about 60%.
* **Take Balanced Diet**
Maintaining a well-rounded diet could significantly reduce anxiety symptoms. Consuming foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and vitamins B and D can help reduce anxiety symptoms.
* **Reduce your Caffeine and Alcohol intake**
Caffeine is well-known as an anxiety inducer. Similarly, while alcohol may initially seem to relax you, it can actually increase feelings of anxiety as it wears off.
* **Make getting a good night‚Äôs sleep a top priority**
While nearly a third of adults get less than 6 hours of sleep a night, the CDC recommends that adults get 7 or more hours of sleep each day to reduce anxiety symptoms. Making getting a good night‚Äôs sleep a top priority can help reduce anxiety symptoms, even in the short term.",,

"TW self harm, suicidal thoughts.

Please tell me if this isn't the right group for this kind of post. 

Hello everyone, I'm not very good at words so apologies if this is a bit rambly.

I'll start with a couple of facts; I've been out of work for 6 months, all of my overdrafts are maxed out, I am so unbelievably anxious and just shit at talking to other humans and I have just recently started a new job that I hate but I know I have to do it for the money.

I have absolutely 0 confidence and since the lock down I feel like I have completely lost my old self. I have gotten worse at pretty much every aspect of socialising (I was never that good in the first place) and my depression has only gotten worse.

I'm at the point now that I will sit in my car and self harm on my breaks at this new job because it's the only way I can chill out enough to go back in instead of just driving home and quitting. I think about suicide all day. I feel trapped and helpless and I just don't know what to do.

Now the second part, my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years. I love her so much and she's definitely the best thing that ever happened to me. She is beautiful, funny, smart and confident. She has always tried to help me with my confidence and is always telling me I need to stand up for myself.

Recently when she says things that I disagree with I have tried to stand up for myself and tell her but every time she gets defensive and we don't argue but she absolutely won't back down to the point that I just give up and let her 'win'. 

I am really bad for forgetting details of things that upset me, I just remember that we had this 'thing' and how it made me feel but not any of the details of what was said (literally minutes after it happens it's like my brain wipes it). I know that this will make it really hard to tell her about how I'm feeling because she'll ask what it is she says that upsets me and I won't be able to tell her.

I have a really shit relationship with my parents and I can barely get through an evening with my 2 closest (and only) friends because I'm so horrifically awkward let alone talk to them about something like this but it's really starting to upset me.

I'm just not enjoying any aspect of life right now. I hate going to work and I don't really want to come home either (my girlfriend and I live together at my parents house). I just have no idea what I should do. I did absolutely shit at school so my job options are very limited and this one was the only one out of literally hundreds of applications that replied to me. I feel so stuck and thinking about the future just makes my skin crawl because in my head I KNOW I'm going to end up killing myself, I just come back to that every time. I have never gone through with a plan but there have been a few close calls now. 

My girlfriend knows about my depression and suicidal thoughts and she does try to help, in fact she's one of the only people that can help.

I know I'm supposed to be asking a question instead of just ranting so I'll leave it at this, does anyone have any ideas about I should do about a) work and b) standing up to my girlfriend?

I know I can't really do the situation justice in a Facebook post but just typing it out has helped me relax a bit so I really appreciate any help you can give me. Sorry for the rant.",,
"this might be a little long so apologies in advance.  first, thanks for letting me join. i've been thinking about joining one of these for a while. would like others to talk to once in a while due to problems. I thought about going into therapy, just never know a good therapist where i live and in the past (and through others) never see them all that much helpful. sometimes the best help is just someone (like a friend) that's truly willing to listen to problems. I'm married, but my wife don't seem to care about my thoughts much or she has no input anyway. I don't know. 

anyway, I'm 43 and I'm introverted. always have been introverted. in the past, i'd be very lonely and depressed due to it. never been the sociable type or some social butterfly. these days I've gotten used to it, and due to some issues with people I just assume most people keep their distance. if I didn't have to work, i'd stay home all day possibly if i could and do things around the house and probably be a bit happier.  I don't go to parties or to clubs/bars, in fact when I do I just get bored. I don't have much hobbies anymore because i spend too much time working because I got bills like everyone else, but I always dreamed to work in media creation and that's what my degrees are in (i have my associates in digital media and my bachelor's in interactive media design) however I'm not the greatest designer, and when I tried to sell myself in this field I never gained much interest. in fact, when I would be unemployed I would always struggle finding work when I would hear about others getting work instantly. that's why when i find a job I keep it long as possible. and I wouldn't say i do bad at job interviews. probably perhaps it's my social awkwardness that causes my struggles. 

I do not know if I have any disabilities of any kind. I don't recall ever being diagnosed, but mom has told me when i was younger that I do have a learning disability. I don't know what it would be though. younger, i thought i was stupid though but older I feel like I can figure out just about anything. I work with the intellectually disabled, and it's a pain dealing with who i work with because the guy has a diagnosed disability and lots of times calls himself stupid and claims he don't have a brain like me. I try explaining to him that if he's stupid than so am i and i'm not stupid and he can figure things out if he wants. this guy can back up a vehicle with a trailer when i can't even do that. so he's not stupid but it's trying to get him to understand he can learn like anyone else.  I could possibly be autistic, but I don't know. I never been diagnosed but see some symptoms of it. I don't even know my IQ level, but have been curious for several years but don't know where to properly find out these things when I don't have a proper therapist.  it's just hard to talk about such things because people that should listen don't want to.

my hobbies include: designing things and making videos/taking pictures (when I got time), reading, watching tv, and trying to understand the world (I tend to question everything I see and hear and things people try to tell me - i'm known to get into heated discussions if I disagree with something). I do believe in God, but i see no evidence for ghosts as one example.

Today was a calm day I‚Äôm slowly going back to myself but due to my emotions being shaken up for the last two days my healing eye surgery began to act up a bit my eyes leaked frequently today also from crying for two days now out of stress my eye is super dry and slowly returning to normal but 

I know I shouldn‚Äôt but my gut told me to activate my account once more to see how every member reacted there was one left from the whole drama 

Apperantly she couldn‚Äôt keep this matter on the low and had to post a status out to others calling me insane telling that no such thing was happening it was all in my head that I‚Äôm in a bad mental headspace 

I‚Äôm in a fed up being take advantage of  and done with people headspace

Making fun how I‚Äôm into cute things 
Forcing me to play game franchise 
Often questioning me why I take breaks 
Whenever there was a topic and I stated my opinion I‚Äôd get told I‚Äôm wrong 

Disagreeing on stuff often 

No like I can‚Äôt stand being on eggshells constantly I had to ditch 

I‚Äôm maturing in areas where I feel the people around me was frozen in time frozen in a place that no longer serves me ngl 5 years ago( when I joined) I was a person who I‚Äôm not AT ALL today 

People change 
People move on 
It makes me wonder why can‚Äôt everyone get this 

So after reading this whole ordeal status I felt so much better leaving more than I‚Äôm feeling already 

It‚Äôs interesting unlike other times I‚Äôd mourn and miss a person for about a month it only took two days and I‚Äôm 90% over them 

In a way I was hating them already so ye cutting them off was so good I‚Äôm no longer carrying this burden 

But however from bad experiences when people mess me up I often remember a tad bit of good times even if it was maybe fake

"In the midst of overwhelming loneliness, I can't help but feel the stark sting of hypocrisy. We're bombarded by endless social media posts about ""mental health awareness."" But when it comes down to it, the silence is deafening. It's like a facade of support is painted on social media platforms while in reality, the outreach for help is met with a cold, indifference.

I've sent messages to over 50 people, hoping for just one person to acknowledge me, to be that beacon of light in this darkness. Instead, I've been blocked, mocked, ignored, or met with ridicule. I've been called a freak, a weirdo, a r*****. 

I battle against self-hatred, feeling utterly unimportant, and wrestling with the reality of having no one to turn to.I hate myself for the vulnerability I'm burdened with, feeling like an inconvenience, feeling small and inconsequential in a world that seems to have no room for me.

The agony of being left alone with these thoughts is unbearable. Feeling like an insignificant figure in a crowded room, yearning for just a sliver of acknowledgment.

Hoping some new place will heal my soul.

Miles build walls, locking emotions inside

Okay.  I'll reword my comment.  It took a severe crisis for my son to be taken seriously concerning his need for long term mental care,,
"I'm new to the group. I don't know how these chats work. I can't afford a counselor. I don't know what I'm supposed to say. Uh, I was an abused child from an alcoholic father from age 4 to 14. I was molested by my 17 year old cousin when I was 10. I was kidnapped by a pedophile when I was 11. I experienced trauma all through my childhood. Then, when I became a teenager, I became a very mean and violent person hurting a lot of people physically. Then, I became addicted to drugs and alcohol and became a drug dealer and criminal. Street fights, gang fights, guns, knives, and it all led to arrests. I've come a long way I guess. I overcame the alcohol and drugs and smoking. I am still struggling with my temper and anger. I now have PTSD, bipolar and fibromyalgia. I have 11 serious injuries and 6 major surgeries that have left me in chronic 24/7 pain over all my body. Now I'm on opioids and gabapentin. I'm not the person I was due to the drugs. I really don't know who I am anymore. I struggle daily with depression and loneliness and suicidal thoughts.",,
Don't know who to talk to. Feel all alone. Don't know how end my life without  someone  trying to  save it.,,

"Life will make you a real asshole. The majority of people I cared about in my life either left me in the dirt, betrayed my trust, stole from me, tried to kill me, or something along those lines. I have no love or empathy left for most people. It's 100% a defense mechanism that took years to develop. Maybe I'm becoming narcissistic I don't know I just feel like I'm a huge asshole and there is no trusting people. I'm sniffing for bullshit constantly and I'm ready to pop off on ANYBODY. I disowned my sister not too long ago. Never gonna speak to her again until our parents are dead. I can't imagine trusting another partner. Idk man I just hate nearly all people.",,

"Possible trigger warning:

I've been trying all of the self help tips like journalling, gratitude journalling, meditation, affirmations, exercising to try and heal myself of the abuse and neglect that I experienced from my family, caretakers, teachers and schoolmates growing up, and I'll admit, it works for a little bit. It actually feels really good for a week or two when I do it consistently, but then something happens where I just stop. It's like i get chills down my spine, my body feels weirdly hollow like a ghost, my eyes feel heavy and I feel drowsy. Has anyone else experienced this? 

P.S.
Before you suggest therapy, I can't afford it, which is why I've been trying to heal on my own. I've tried free and low cost options and had a horrible experience. I basically let myself be a guinea pig to masters students, and that left a sour taste in my mouth. I also used the university's counselling services and they were bad. The therapist was dismissive and threw CBT down my throat whereas I needed validation and mirroring.",,
"TRIGGER WARNING, 

I believe I have long covid and back in march i had a really bad time where I couldn't do anything in the house etc, 

Well my son was removed from my care temporarily and I couldn't work out what the symptoms were - I thought I was getting old (back aches) and that I was fat (mobility problems ) and eating junk (breathing problems ) fatigue (anemia etc) sleep problems (stress) 

Plus other issues (10 out of 15 ) and i only noticed yesterday it could be long covid as a reason everything went wrong & I found out today I might never see my son again because they don't care I am ill and said my son better without me, 

So I may lose my beautiful boy for a illness millions of people had, 

I am really struggling and don't want to live if I lose my baby forever üòû",,
"I‚Äôm currently working with Kaiser for my mental health issues. I find it very challenging to work with Kaiser.

Any advice for me is greatly appreciated.",,
"I'm so down, my family member is in mental hospital.  I've been left with their dog and to pay any unpaid bills.  I'm into my savings now because I am not allowed family members bank card. Bearing in mind my family member wants me to have my money I have paid out already but not allowed.  Today I had booked a chiropodist for family member and turned up at the hospital to pay them cash, as arranged.  Obv nurse in charge feels she has the authroity not to allow me to see family member and pay the chiropodist cash.  I had to leave the hospital because I can not talk or deal with idiotic people.  So I have had to go against myself and do bank transfer, my way is cash and that's what I organised with the chiropodist, cash.  I know it might sound petty but surly I am allowed to book a service and pay how I decide, it's my money.
They have had my family member a while, like keeping her prisoner as such and reluctant to let them home. I'm sorry but I have no respect for these people in authority, done no favours to me and total upset all day long because of them.  What makes things worse is any correspondence I have had from these so called professionals is that their spelling is atrocious.  If you can not spell or even compose an email better than me, how can I respect someone in authroity.
I might suffer from a bit of depression but the local mental health hospital is messing with me and making me totally more depressed.  My honest opinion they seem a bunch of idiots with spelling worse than mine.   I believe my family member they are holding thinks this too, well on them lines.
Thanks got it off my chest.",,
"How to explain this? 

Okay first of all since I got my surgery for my lacrimal duct I‚Äôve been barely crying cus crying actually makes burn not now as much tough 

So I finally brewer my bottling fuse and sobbed hysterically today 

So my strategy for distraction is whenever I feel hopeless I try not to dwell instead mask it 

I was using drawing and talking to others online to pushing out the pain I was feeling of not going out often down and keeping it bottled 

Cause to be honest I went insane trying to understand this but sadly I cannot drive I‚Äôm very prone to anxiety and panic attacks along with blacking out 

So I rely on my mom as a 27 yr old 

Going out in my life is a rare treat 

I get it I got surgery I needed to rest but for gods sake it‚Äôs been two weeks since the doctor said I‚Äôm free to go out at this point I think you‚Äôre being paranoid 

Yes I‚Äôm aware we‚Äôre not familiar with many places but I don‚Äôt think that excuses 

Also yeah it‚Äôs awful how stepdad been distant since forever or since we moved to this house on December 25th 2022

But always I suggested stuff it felt like I always begged to go out so I stopped I come to a conclusion I‚Äôll rot in this room and be filled with empty promises cause I‚Äôm also teased often of going around this or that place 

Yes I also get how the world is dangerous so there‚Äôs that among many many things 

So I poured it out I blew it out 

She heard things she may not want to hear it was important 

I spend most days in my room trying to distract myself and also preventing from us arguing since I overthink and my mind won‚Äôt stop running 

Sometimes I often think I shouldn‚Äôt have made this surgery okay I dunno 

But she‚Äôs like ‚Äú we going out tomorrow‚Äù 

At this point 

I don‚Äôt believe anything anymore I‚Äôve been let down time and time again 

Yeah I get how stuff goes on in her life too I just wish she let me be more dependent and fly free 

Before you go ‚Äúoh live  alone‚Äù 

Thought of that but I often have a gut feeling to where I wouldn‚Äôt have luxury I do 

It‚Äôs luxury but I pay a price 

Just like she‚Äôs with stepdad still for money and comfort life 

I‚Äôm with her for the same reason 

We‚Äôre both rotten gold diggers and comfort diggers",,
I'm so sick of feeling like this. I lost myself a long time ago. What's worse is I have no emotional support from pretty much anyone especially from those I put my trust in.  Things just keep getting worse and what makes it even harder is most around me just look at me like a screw up loser whatever who knows what they really think...and to be honest I don't care what they think because I know how damn hard I work to survive each day. I also think it's sad that complete strangers treat me better than family and supposed friends. Example...I do door dash and almost literally accidentally ran over an older couple pulling into a parking lot to pick up an order (mind you I've been beyond stressed) and I was like omg I'm so sorry I literally didn't see you I am SOOo very sorry...they both where like no no it's okay your good it happens...I'm thinking dude I almost ran you over I felt so bad even if they were in my blind spot and it was raining I still kept apologizing because I should have been more aware.  The lady goes hun your good have a good day with a smile on her face. ü´£ I literally still feel bad about it but they shrugged it off like it was nothing...why can't I be like that..I get angry over less than that for real now a days and maybe it's because of the consistent stress I'm under and my whole life going to hell but still no excuse for my anger.  Blessed Be I am soooo over everything but I'm really trying to hang in there with no support from a jerk of a spouse (another too long of a story not even worth telling) ugh üòÆ‚Äçüí®,,

"When your child hates you more than the abusive drug user. Says a lot about who you think you are as a parent. For her to feel completely alone while she was in your presence 24/7 is devastating news! I feel like my mere existence is still causing her harm. I wasn't a good mother for sure I was detached from reality for many years, and causing my children harm from my untreated mental health. No words can be said to undo the pain I'll caused them, at times I think the change I'm doing within myself is all for nothing. What has been done, can be undone and for that I'm forever sorry.",,

"Just some thoughts. I‚Äôm trying in my mid fifties to progress. After floundering for decades. 

Four ingredients to well being 
1. Occupation or Work
2. Food. 3. Sleep
4. Medication if necessary. 

The problem is a catch 22. For forty years I have not been allowed to get work training. Because I have been deemed too ill. But occupation is as vital as food sleep and medication for being well

Otherwise self esteem will rot and mental health will get worse and worse. I don‚Äôt think anyone would deprive me of food or sleep or even my medicine before waiting for me to recover. As in the words of a very top consultant in London ‚Äú Work is the best therapy ‚Äú. And each time I get unwell management decides to delay helping me get volunteering.  It‚Äôs the only real cause of my continuing setbacks. I can‚Äôt get well without feeling useful in society. aNd feeling useless in society makes me get chronic mental illness. My occupational therapy scheme was withdrawn from me becsuse I felt bad about myself. 

For me the more proactive things are. And I mean really proactive. The better. Being forced to stay in the slow lane despite A levels and published books is very frustrating. I don‚Äôt mean to annoy kind supporters who read this. Everyone has helped. I just find it exasperating that work which is like an essential vitamin is constantly something that no care worker is really preparing me intensely enough for. I‚Äôm losing weight but I need really really proactivity

There‚Äôs one thing much worse than being accelerated and going too fast and that is going too slowly. I have complained week in week out about the heavy sedation I‚Äôm on.  I think it is ‚Äò helpful‚Äô but I believe strongly in going round in circles despite my incredible determination. The pills thoygh generally excellent - one medicine I‚Äôve been on 21 years I think is in the very long run slowing me down 

Doctors and other healthcare workers especially in my life deserve the greatest praise and gratitude. But I would really hope they don‚Äôt abandon the greatest intensity of effort to help me out of this pit

Being relegated to mental health care instead of occupational preparation is not going to improve matters. I feel upset. If one falls down in a race one does not go backwards to make more progress. One should take a deep breath and carry on moving forward

Yes I had an episode. I believe that‚Äôs why I lost my occupational course. I‚Äôm disappointed but it seems for the sake of health caution I will be going round and round this circle forever. I could have done a lot lot more with my life. It‚Äôs disappointing. 

I‚Äôve been careless I know but I do have good intentions. It is not an easy trap to escape. sorry for a long post but I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback. üòä",,
"I try not to rely on yesterday or the past lately but I regret answering aunt‚Äôs phone call last night she was a huge energy vampire being all dramatic and stuff that today I woke up sort of weird like my energy  is unbalanced

"So, earlier I was on a downer. Sleep deprived is the contribution and I'm looking for love. But ever since (I have no idea, how many years I've been trying) I've been searching. I consistently get nothing but bad luck. I get ignored, rejected, blocked (for apparently no good reason whatsoever) ghosted, toxic intrusive nonsense, someone who has found someone else. Etc. It's a minefield. My hope and faith of ever finding someone is at zero % I have truly given up, but as it's the human spirit. We keep persevering, but why should I anymore. As it's in vain. There's someone who is interested, I've been chatting with her for weeks. We get on, she seems genuinely interested in me. But she's not keen on meeting up. She's telling me, she's not ready. I feel a connection, but I feel she's just reassuring me by saying that she will meet up. I feel like she's not being honest with me. I have trust issues, as humans have a poor tendency to not be honest. I'm different, I have a honest policy. 

So with this going on. I've lost interest in her. I got depressed because of sleep deprivation and I'm so tired of being alone. I have lost all faith and hope in life. I will die alone. I'm not gonna bother anymore. It's all a waste of time. Thanks to this latest quest, I got emotional and I was crying. I was in deep mental anguish. I suffer so much. I am the world's most unluckiest guy. 

Ironically, I treat them well, I am nice, decent, genuine, honest, loyal. Good and proper manners. Yet I get treated so unfairly. Why? I am so tired of this consistent nonsense. I am cursed with bad luck. I'm done. When this gets to me........I'm sorry I feel that way. I'm crying üò≠ again. I have suffered enough. . I am a good guy and yet I get a bad deal. I don't try too hard. I be nice & yet I have to suffer rejection. I hurt so much. I can't stand being alone. Ugh, sorry I am so pathetic. I'm 52 years old and I'm sobbing like a baby.

"Random status cuz why not:

I think‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 90% ready to be social again while guarding myself not to be hurt with others again 

Not to get too attached and let my guard down 

I‚Äôve been online socializing lately for now since I‚Äôm still healing for surgery hopefully after the 14th of this month I can back into the social scene 

But yeah I‚Äôve been making connections again since 2020 and it feels pretty damn good 

I‚Äôve woken up and realized I was being manipulated by my mother 

Like I get it you should keep your guard up for people cause it‚Äôs not rainbow and sunshine but you shouldn‚Äôt be paranoid either 

And listening to her so much her views on people was making me paranoid 

Her level is like 

The other mother from Caroline 

Is the best comparison explanation I can do 

So yeah I follow my gut while not getting myself hurt 

But yeah these last couple of days I‚Äôve been working on my art while socializing on discord 

Now listen yeah I know it‚Äôs awful specially discord but if you think about it all is awful 

Every social media 
Every media 
Every celebrity everything that it exists 

But but not all is bad there‚Äôs good and bad side to all things 

The world I realize it‚Äôs not just black and white thetes so much beauty and ugliness at the same time 

It‚Äôs messy but yet it‚Äôs so beautiful

Well I became lost in the Bad Neighborhood of my head, and was Spinning out, not presnt enough to get help my self, and to employ the many tools I have been taught to make living tolerable. My Friend dean came over, and tried to guide me through some grounding exercises Little did dean know I had been spinning for a day, nhe handled easy stuff, he threwm into a Bath and cleaned me up, Called a muatal friend and said he needed him to come and feed me,  by all indications, he was telling our friend  I haven't eaten all week, (true dat) and I threw up what he tried to feed me.",,

rom my personal experiences people who are labeled as intellectually disabled/neurodivergent. often have our mental health concerns brushed off by professionals because a lot of professionals assume that people labeled as intellectually disabled/neurodivergent, can not have mental illnesses because of our other diagnosis. 

yet those who are labeled as intellectually disabled/neurodivergent. 
are often very quickly and without proper cause or based on what  family and caregivers say. put on psychiatric medications to control what society see as inappropriate or bad behaviour. 

i was put on my first psychiatric medication at age 12 to control what was considered violent behaviour. 

which unknown to anyone because i am AFAB(assigned female at birth) until i was diagnosed at 30 with autism.

where autistic meltdowns do to not being able to express my emotions and feelings is a way the society deems acceptable. do i still have autistic meltdowns? not really. as i have grown the meltdowns changed to shut downs which are kinda sorta easier to manage. 

do i have mental illness?absolutely i have multiple mental illnesses 

but thankfully i have a really good team of professionals and other people in my life now",,

"So, I'm done with quetiapine. After taking a dosage of 100mg last night. I went to bed sometime after 21:20. I woke up this morning at 11:45. Fifteen hours sleep! Absolutely ridiculous. I am aware of this stupid side effect. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. So I'm gonna discuss a med review. I've been on them for weeks and they are making no difference to my mental health. I feel lousy and lethargic at the moment. I don't want to feel like this and I'm done with downing that type of antidepressant. I'm feeling emotional now and I'm tired of being alone. I was supposed to meet up a friend today at noon and I tired to get to the arranged place. I had to text to let her know I was running late and arranged to meet later. But I got to a certain place before the rendezvous. But I had to turn back and go home. As I felt awful. Stupid ridiculous antidepressant. Thanks, for messing my plan for today. I'm now home and I'm tired of being alone. I wish I made a effort to meet up with my friend. I'm so useless and stupid. I don't need this stupid ridiculous antidepressant and this nasty horrible side effect! 

I feel lousy at the moment and not in the best of moods. Is there anyone free to chat?",,

You don‚Äôt own explanation to no one cause often people won‚Äôt listen and it will give you more a hard time 

But ye it‚Äôs been two days and I‚Äôve been relaxed again and I‚Äôm not sure if I wanna go back 

One thing I realized in my 20‚Äôs is to hang or do what is good for me and this is not the vibe so I‚Äôll stay away as it‚Äôs not being useful

"****Potential TW****
Childhood trauma,  adult trauma.

I have a question for everyone, I appreciate that it might be slightly different for everyone, 

As the oldest child I was never wanted by by stepfather, my mum wouldn't say anything, I was constantly bullied by my siblings, by anyone really, at school, my granddad told my really dad before I was born he was not welcome forcing him out of my life, before my mum meet my stepdad she pushed me away to my aunties every weekend. My stepdad grounded and bullied me for the slightest thing  I ended up moving in with my grandparents at the age of 9 they didn't want me. So everytime I picked myself up tried again.
Anyway in my adult life it was the same, I married she had an affair with my stepbrother which virtually everyone in my family knew about and they encouraged.  Then from then on I've been getting back up, I am 51 now, the thing is I know everyone says get up dust yourself off, I have been for over 47 years, I moved away, still get the same crap where I go. I am seriously unsure how much more of being knocked down I can take",,

"I‚Äôm feeling a bit lost feel free to delete it but thinking over and over is killing me 

I say feel free to delete cuz it‚Äôs not mental health related but hair related 

As you all know I‚Äôm still healing from surgery but once I can do normal stuff again ima get my hair dye touched up and a new cut cuz it‚Äôs looking so dull so anyways 

Lately I‚Äôm highly invested in both side undercut idk the sight of seeing not fully shaved head makes me so happy it just looks so cool specially with bangs lmk If I can post the reference photo 

I heard the pros and cons tbh I‚Äôm not bothered however idk who to share in person since I don‚Äôt have many people in my life so I shared with mom today and she gave me a look and said ‚Äúso just bangs? That looks odd I dunno today‚Äôs people hair cuts‚Äù 

And idk it made me unsure even tho I want it so bad 

My heart since the age of 16 always been into tattoos, hair dyes and piercing which I want it all 

Life is short I wanna feel comfortable in my skin as possible but 

Only thing holds me back how my family reacts which idk why it makes me hesitant so I get repressed and unease wanting stuff but unsure

Now my question is for the people up there they know all , why do you think that does illness as ppl consider, are synonym of violence and lais?
Can you understand that in some cases like mine it is the opposite.
Some mental problems come when the people think they see the illness and not the person.

"I‚Äôm not even sure who to ask this question so I post here and yes it‚Äôs surgery related only because my doctor won‚Äôt answer whenever I go for check up it‚Äôs usually very quickly he is also my surgeon so he is often doing surgery 

He told me to eat whatever 
Do whatever but he did not answer me this 

I know within 3 months is my next appointment to remove my eye stent but my question is 

If anyone had a surgery similiar to mine

How long did it take you to get back to your normal life routine? Like going out and such 

For me if it wasn‚Äôt for the barely bruise since it‚Äôs fading a lot and scar scabs along with the stent I‚Äôm pretty much all healed my nose barely hurts from time to time 

I only ask bc I‚Äôm starting to miss going out and I find myself somedays getting into a small depression funk even tho I‚Äôm engaging on hobbies 

I wanna see how much I should wait more

"I‚Äôm looking for a little advice here. I have an almost 4y/o and my husband and I are thinking about trying for baby #2 in the next few months. I feel ready, I‚Äôm excited, and this is something I really want. However, I‚Äôm terrified. When my son was 6 months old, I was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and I began having really disturbing intrusive thoughts that I was going to intentionally harm him. This kept getting worse and worse as he got older and I ended up in the hospital twice after he turned 3 (SI/attempts). If convinced myself that if I was around, my baby was in danger, and I wasn‚Äôt about to let that happen. I came across a journal I kept during that time (suggested by my therapist), and what I wrote in it is extremely disturbing. I was talking about hating my life, hating my son, hating my husband, etc. at that point, I was doing harm to myself physically.

I‚Äôve been great for 7+ months now, and have spoken with my OB, therapist and psychiatrist who have all cleared me as safe to get pregnant, but I‚Äôm still terrified. 

I know no one can tell me what to do, but any advice/experience/opinion is welcome. I want another baby, but I want to make sure myself and everyone I love would be safe if that happened.",,
"Long post, I had all this in my head and needed to get it all out. 

For the past few months I've been suffering. Mostly from my own making. 

I've been too scared of the world outside of my front door, to see or speak to people would make me physically sick. 

To be in such a dark place, a place so lonely so misunderstood a place where leaving your family behind becomes an option is so hard to explain. 
I've wanted to live and die in the same breath, I've wanted to defend and scold myself, I've wanted to run and stay. 
 Noone is infallible we have all made bad choices in life but I'm learning and being told that what you do or did doesnt define you, your actions after are what count. 

I have apologiesed, and done all I can to right my wrong. I can only do that. What people choose to believe or think of me beyond that is out of my control another thing I'm learning to deal with.

I'm wanting to become a better person. But I also have to understand perfection is not achievable, for anyone. 

I have since loosing my mum suffered with my mental health, but I'm also a stubborn and independent person and so have constantly denied how much help I've actually needed. So I have painted on a smile and made it through each day with more or less know one knowing the real emotions of the day. Having high functional depression just means your Ill but your running constantly from everything.

I've been snappy, happy, sad, excited, lonely, exhausted and pretty much every other emotion in one day all because my 'mask' required me to. Asking for help didn't feel like an option and on the occasions I did I have just been handed tablets and told they would 'make it better' They don't they just stop you feeling the real pain and instead you feel numb and a constant inability to understand why you just can't feel better. 

I've lived like this for years.  Years of pretending years of asking myself why I'm not good enough why I am the way I am. 

Recently the 'feelings bucket' became so full that It all started to spill out. My behaviour became erratic I lost all interest in everything I pretended to want to move my life in a different direction but the reality was I wanted everything to just end. 

Leaving your family your children, the lives you grew, love and raised behind with the thought of taking your own life is something you can not describe. 
Breaking the trust with the man you love who has tried so hard in the past to help you whilst you constantly throw it back at him was not as easy as I thought it would be. 

Walking away I thought was the right thing to do. But coming back was the hardest thing to do and that was the right thing to do. 
What's so difficult to understand is that I have wanted help and asked for help but when your told time and time again that the waiting list is to long or you don't meet the criteria, go private you really are left with a feeling of maybe I am better off dead. 

But suddenly I'm getting lots of help so much. There are so many organisations and services out there but YOU have to find them. 
When your in a dark place of despair that is a daunting task and the reason so many don't. 
If your struggling please make that first step. Talking to someone is much easier that you think and the judgement you think you will receive isn't there. 
I spent 20 mins crying ... No sobbing to a doctors receptionist, she didn't judge she spoke to me she told me to let it all out and the when I could take a breath and just tell her what I could. Because of that simple act I was suddenly on the path that will I hope make everything better for me. 
I have spoken to so many people and said things I honestly didnt know was inside me. I still have a long way to go but I'm now wanting to get better and I know I can. 

I have listened to audiobooks about the importance of self care, something I actually thought I did untill I heard the words that showed me I actually didn't/don't care for myself at all. 

I've taken up hobbies that I didn't have before so that I can do things to take me out of my own head. Colouring has been such a life line, I've spent hours building my children's Lego I've started yoga, this is self care. 

Now I have a goal that really should be so simple... To leave my house to be able to walk outside my front door. I have only just been able to sit in my garden a place I absolutely loved to be but it was to scary to be there but with help and support I've got there and I know that I'll get to everyone of my goals with that same help and support but also with self belief. I am worth the help I'm getting something I truly believed I wasn't. 

My children and my husband (sometimes üòâ) have been my rock. They have held me when I've cried. Listened when I have talked and sat with me when I needed silence never once pushed me and only offered encouragement. 
The love and understanding makes me so proud and is teaching me that whilst I don't think I'm being a good mum to them right now I am educating the on the importance of mental health issues how much talking is needed. Problems won't go away with out it. 
This is an invaluable life lesson for us all. 
This will as a family make us so much stronger but also the ability to cope with the inevitable hurdles that will come our way. 
I hope that my children will because of this become equipped to help and support their friends and partners having a much deeper understanding. 
It's so easy to say if you ever need me just yell or I'm always here.... Showing up is when you really show you care. I hope now they can and will always be able to see the difference. 

My friends have been fabulous, some for doing exactly what I've wanted and staying away leaving me alone after sending me several messages and getting no reply. For this I am greatful. 
Others have been more persistent, but in the nicest possible way. The best possible way, they have gently reminded me they are there and going nowhere, they have checked in knowing they may not get a reply. They have checked in on my family making sure they are ok to. For this I'm eternally greatful. Life has a funny way of showing you what is or isn't or who is or isn't important. I've always believed that everything happens for a reason and I'm being taught so very much right now.",,

"My boyfriend can do research online and every article he reads he can tell is fact and not bullshit. But when I do research online he says you can't trust what you read and that I don't know which websites have valid information. 

We're in a disagreement about is wet or dry food better for your dogs. I've found several sources that state that they both have benefits but he's insisting that dry food has no nutritional value and is no benefit to our dogs. Despite the fact that our oldest two have dental issues and I've read multiple things that say that dry food helps prevent dental issues and based on that information and the fact that our dogs eat only wet food and our oldest two have teeth and gum disease I can see how those are accurate and valid statements but he still wants to argue that our dogs wouldn't benefit from hard food. I'm saying they should have a balanced diet of both. But that's still not an agreeable answer for him. Although he says he will feed them whatever I buy them. I just know if he doesn't think they should eat dry food. He either won't feed it to them or he will find some way to complain and make it seem like wet food is better and the dogs don't like the dry. Despite the fact that I'm the only one working and buying the food and a strictly wet diet is very expensive. 

My point is. I don't know who is crazy anymore. I feel like he's constantly manipulating me or twisting facts or talking in circles or even contradicting himself but when I point out the inconsistencies he acts like what I'm saying is completely fabricated. Like I'm just hearing things that he's not really saying. And I'm losing my fucking mind. All of our arguments are like this. Whether it's about what food the dogs should eat. What medications our autistic daughter should take. What grown up information my teenage daughter should know. They're all just in circles and have no answers or any way to be resolved. I feel like I'm talking to a wall. But I'm also not sure if I'm the problem. He says he's open minded but the things he says comes off pretty closed minded to me and idk.

"I'm hurting so bad right now and for the first time after everything I've gone through since the pandemic and everyone I lost, I don't want to be here any more. This world is too cruel. This world doesn't deserve a kind hearted person like me and I think my spirit would be better off somewhere else. After losing my mom,, aunt, best friend, 2 cousins, my job of 11 years and and even my 17 yr old dog all because of covid, my wife who suffers from mental illness stopped taking her meds and disappeared with all my valuables and my children and tried to destroy our beautiful new home that I had just bought out here in the lonely country of West Ga last year and I wasn't able to get any help. As hard as it was to cope, I managed through the help of the mental health community. I even started a website so that I could help others going through what I'm going through because I know how hard it is. But I never would've thought I would find love again as I'm a broken man who has suffered and was afraid to move on. One day I'm playing a mobile game and through the chat of this game I met what I thought was the most beautifully spirited, understanding and loving girl I've ever met and after weeks of chatting which is something I don't even do, I fell madly in love with this person. After 2 months of sharing the most intimate details of my life with who I thought was my true soul mate, I proposed and was so excited that she accepted and that's when I thought God answered my prayers. But last night by accident, I ended up finding the real person behind the 150+ photos that this imposter has been using to scam me and it broke my heart. After reaching out to who I thought was my true love to find out what's going on, this person still won't come clean. As beautiful as the girl in the pictures are, looks didn't matter to me because I fell in love with this person's heart but yet this person still won't reveal their true self. We would stay up all night chatting and sharing our days with each other. My heart is so broken. I haven't slept. I can't eat and all I've done is cried. I truly am alone. Surrounded by the most ravenous sharks in deep water with no way out. I know people are going to say pray but I pray faithfully every single day. I even fast every Monday to help me connect with God. But now that my already once shredded heart has now been completely crushed and torn to pieces I don't know why else I'm here. I just want to have someone to love and share my life with but someone who will love me equally. But now I see there is no such thing. I've always been told that I am rare because of how I love and that the world is a better place with me in it because others could learn from me but how true is this? This can't be the world they're talking about because this world is full of hate, betrayal, and cruelty. I don't want to be a part of that anymore. I don't have anyone left to talk to so I am truly alone. None of us were meant to be alone. There's somebody for everybody except for me. So maybe it's time for me to move on. I've never felt like this before but I accept it. I can't take anymore. I know everyone is going to say the same thing they've conditioned themselves to say but I don't need kind words what I need is love. If you're someone I can talk to please DM me because I don't know how this FB stuff works and I'm posting anonymous so that my family doesn't get involved. All they do is judge and really don't care. If you want to see what I look like respond to this post and I will gladly share video or something with you so that you know I am real and not a scammerüíîüòîüò¢üò≠",,

"Part 2
I have been on constant fight with myself whether to go on with this but today I had a trigger. I get used to seeing police officers in and out of our compound and later my dad was unseen or heard.Later I came to realize he had been arrested and was in police custody.All this time Grandma had shifted to a different village and my mother was heavily pregnant with her second born.This woman must have gone through a lot.
This phase of my life is totally blank in my mind because the next event I see us shifting from our village to a different village.it was on a rainy evening and everything was packed up on a tractor apparently the white settler had excommunicated my mother due to the husbands action.I remember being rained on and I saw my mother cry all the way.
We started a new life,I made new friends and neighbors.It was time to join kindergarten and my mum took me to a school that was quite a distance from our home as it was the only school around.I had to walk to and from in the middle of farms as farming was the main activity of the villagers. I remember one day on my way home I met with a man at one corner he said hi and told me shake hands which I innocently did only to realize it was not his hand but penisü´¢.I got confused but luckily there was someone approaching so he had to run away.I never told anyone about this but every time I would get there I would get so scared and tensed.Upto date I really have lots of questions on what would have happened if no one showed up.I was a smart pupil as mostly the class teacher would leave me teaching my classmates.Also Kindergarten takes 3 years then was baby class to middle class then top before joining primary school but for me I did 2years as the teachers said they could not contain me one more year.
During my kindergarten days I have memories of my dad visiting and would bring me magazines which I would read and flow smoothly.He would not believe it.There was also constant fights between my parents that I would mostly hear late at night.I would severaly hear my mother sob from her bedroom.This period my dad had started selling thrift clothes in town as his Aunt had taken him in and employed him.Though again he was not a regular at home.My Mum had began farming and also would do some manual jobs to take care of me and my brother.
I had an interview to transit from Kindergarten to primary school My dad took me.I did well as I was the leading pupil from all schools who had participated that day.My dad bought me bread and some Fanta soda and it was a happy day for me.This is also the last day I saw him in a long period of time.

"**Depression** is a complex mental health condition, and there are many factors that can contribute to its prevalence in modern times. Here are some possible reasons why people may be experiencing depression more frequently now:
1. Increased stress: Modern life can be hectic and stressful, with work, family, and financial pressures. This stress can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which are common symptoms of depression.
1. Social isolation: With the rise of social media and remote work, many people are spending more time alone, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
1. Trauma: Experiences of trauma, such as abuse, violence, or natural disasters, can trigger or exacerbate depression.
1. Environmental factors: Environmental factors such as air pollution, noise pollution, and lack of access to green spaces can also impact mental health and contribute to depression.

5.    Stigma: Despite progress in reducing stigma surrounding         mental health, negative attitudes and discrimination towards           people with mental health conditions can still make it difficult           for individuals to seek help and recover.

"TW:  relapse in eating disorder recovery, eating disorder behaviors
.
.
.
.
.
.
Hello, I recently had a relapse in eating disorder recovery.  I wanted to share the things I learned from it in hopes that someone would benefit from them and in order to destigmatize talking about things like this.

1) Presence and awareness allow you to see more clearly what it is that you need to learn.  What does that even mean?  It means ***accepting*** that this (relapsing) is where you are at and ***watching*** yourself go through what it is that you need to go through with ***curiosity*** and without judgment.  This is by no means my first relapse (I have had EDs for 20+ years), but it is the first one that I was able to bring this presence and awareness into the experience.  It is a shift in the mindset from viewing relapse as a failure to a growth opportunity.

2) Non-judgment, kindness, and compassion for yourself allow you to get through a relapse more easily.  When you accept that relapses may happen and can be beneficial for your growth, you won't judge yourself and get caught up in guilt and shame.  Guilt and shame can keep you stuck repeating your trauma cycles and prolong getting back to recovery.  You deserve kindness and compassion from yourself, especially in your darkest moments.

3) Addiction patterns and trauma cycles are literal, physical neural networks in your brain.  I had the knowledge of this from working with my therapist but the physical reality of this really hit home with this relapse.  I didn't feel much pain in my digestive system the day after a binge/purge episode.  However, I did experience what felt like a frontal lobe migraine that kept me bedridden for over 24 hours.  The reason for this is because the neural networks in my brain that stored my trauma responses and that I had been working on healing for years suddenly got ripped open again.

I hope that this benefits somebody.  If you can learn from what I went through without having to go through what I went through, that would be really great.  :)  If you are currently struggling with an eating disorder and would be willing to share your experience, I would be honored to hear your perspective.",,

Hi everyone this post is gona be a rollercoaster but please bare with me , I have been diagnosed with ADHD/BPD ever since i was a young  and it has been so difficult when it comes to therapy and accepting therapy, I got into mental institution at the age of 16 , imagine going to a mental institution in a 3rd world country , I was treated like shit that when eventually when I was out I was more truamtized than before the following years I was totally broken and was very impulsive and my mother diagnosed with bi polar didn't make life easier she had a severe eating disorder and she would tell me horrible stuff because I am overweight and eating was a way for me to comfort myself  then after I finshed high school , I made a group of toxic people that was my downfall as I was impulsively doing drugs / alcohol but after a year of that I lost one of my friends due to SA and what breaks my heart more he loved me and I treated him like shit , he tried telling me he needed help I just stopped trying to help him cuz I stopped caring at some moment until I got the news he SA... and I traveled to Malaysia finshed my college degree now I am back to Egypt, working a 12 hour shift that pays a total of 250 dollars , keep it mind egypt economy is do bad so this is actually in egypt a good salary , I am working as a customer service representative I keep hearing complains and people shouting and it doesn't stop to this my manger is so toxic and treats me unfairly , yesterday I told her I feel sick she went and escalated the case to the account manger that I always get sick and that's so upsetting because I'm always on time and I am always doing my best so thar broke my heart and I cried a lot , she told me he was checking on you that's all but still that was my first communication with the acc manger she just made my image look weak while I was hard to keep a good image and to be always on time and doing a good job despite me being a new employee.
Anyways,I am trying to travel outside of egypt but I am very scared/worried because I can't seem to find a cheap English speaking country where I can feel comfortable, or I am thinking getting into a cosmetology school to be able to get a visa there and looking for a part time.job but I don't know what country would suit me on my case.

"TRIGGER WARNING: DRUG USE RELATED QUESTION...  My best friend a long time heroin user, discovered Phenomenal about four weeks ago, about the last time anyone heard from him. Well his dad called me yesterday to inquire about Paul, I told him it had been about as long since I have heard from him and I said Tomorrow will take the ferry into the city and check in on him and report  back.

Which I am doing tomorrow, I need a day to prepare me head. I was diagnosed with AIDS IN 1986, and one doesn't survive the worst of it by pumping garage madeoisens into their body, I have a very strong mind body practice, and one of the top wholeistic healers in the country...

Now my question seeking advice...

I have been trying to educate myself on phenomenal addiction, and everything I have read tells me life expectancy for a hard core addict is about 6 weeks,. I had a stroke about 6 months ago and can no longer think on my feet, and I don't lie EVER.

So at PAULS impending funeral, I know his dad is going to approach me and want to know the skivvy. I feel strongly it's not my take to tell, and I don't want his Dad feeling JUST MAYBE IF... and spending the rest of his life wondering,

Is it fair to say I tried many times to get him help, and once stayed in treatment With him four 4 week to try to free him from that deemon, The drug is just too good the only way to beat it is to never use it. And he crossed that bridge. I was supportive till he started stealing and shooting people to get it, I couldn't abide by the violence to, so I didn't become a victim I had to minimize contact..

But what do I tell his Dad, who idolizes Paul, do I piss all over Pss all over Paul's !memory, or allow him to have his fantasy who Paul was.

I am currently thinking, A day, a week, A month, the second he made the choice to try that drug, the outcome was foretold.

I am of half a mind to tell him he was very special to Paul, and if there was a way Paul would have tried it, there is just no coming back",,

"Tw‚Ä¶ my story 

My story..

When I was 14 the county council for children gave up on me‚Ä¶

A little background. I was placed into care at 4. Fostered till 7 then placed with a failed adoption home untill 11. I then went back to Worcester county council. Where I was placed in diffrent homes around Worcestershire. 

At first I lived in a 6 bed children‚Äôs home. At 11 seeing kids old as 16-17 smoking drinking self harming. Kicking off. It was daunting. I ended up self harming. Distorying my belongings and even trying to end my life. 

The staff tried to help but sadly where not trained well enough to handle these behaviours‚Ä¶ 

This was the first of many things that was wrong with Worcester. 

My next home was in wyre piddle. (Pershore) a 3 bed home. Much better suited to my needs‚Ä¶ how ever there was a younge person there that at 12 years old scared me! 

He was vilont and would self injur himself in front of me. The police were called many times. 

This causing my mental health to get worse. And at this point I was to damaged for the incorrectly trained staff to help me! 

I ended up needing to go into respite (aka short breaks) to a home in Manchester. That I hated! I told them never ever put me there again! 

Anyways. 6 weeks later I was back in wrye piddle this home was now moving (the whole home) to a new building in Worcester! 

It‚Äôs name was oak house‚Ä¶

By the time I got there I was damaged. I had seen things no 13 year old would have to see.  But for care kids ‚Äúit was normal‚Äù at this point they did not know they had caused me c-ptsd! They did not know that I was depressed! Yet if they had been given the right training and the right help from therapists they might have known! 

Whilst living at oak house. I started to try and find myself again. Tried to find where I belonged. I felt some what safe there. Even tho my behaviour may have said otherwise‚Ä¶ 

But by this point rather than trying to help me they had secret meeting discussing what they was gonna do with me‚Ä¶ had no one thought about therapy‚Ä¶ counciling‚Ä¶ finding safe coping strategies‚Ä¶ 

Towards the end of this placement I was screaming for help. Yet no one was able to see this‚Ä¶ in the end they gave up on me. I was removed from this home placed in Mottingham where I was beaten abused and neglected‚Ä¶ then lied to and moved back to Manchester where they lied to me. Twisted my words. Locked me away. And treated me like crap! 

Socail workers. Carers and mangers choice to give up on me rather than finding a way to set me straight! Rather than seeing all I needed was routine. Rules! And a reset button! 

But no! They gave me never ending suffering! C-ptsd! Mental health issues! And a life I‚Äôm not proud of! 

Now I know these homes are not to fault even tho they are the issue! I know the real issue lays with the way they are run. By who they are run! And by what they have to offer‚Ä¶ 

But knowing these things doesn‚Äôt give me and 100s like me justice! Every time it gets quite I still hear the screams of kids being restrained. Every time I close my eyes I am scared to open them incase I‚Äôm back in those homes. Every time I sleep I am disturbed by the nightmares I once lived through! I can‚Äôt go back to where I called home incase I see my old staff‚Ä¶ when I do I have break downs for days! 

All this pain and suffering because Worcester children first choice not to put me. A child! First‚Ä¶",,

"How being outside can trigger the flow state of mind
1. What is flow?
Flow state describes a feeling where, under the right conditions, you become fully immersed in whatever you are doing. In this state, your mind is extraordinarily sharp and able to create effortlessly, and you're joyful and often humorous.
2. What are the benefits of being in the flow state of mind?
Creating art or doing other work is so easy that you think they are done automatically. You feel good and love life. Flow state is beneficial for physical and mental health.
3. How being outside can trigger the flow state of mind?
Being outside can be a potent trigger for states of flow where your mind quiets, and you find yourself more immersed in your sensory experience.
Sitting in nature silently, your mind becomes quiet, and your negative feelings like fear, worry, anger, and so on fade away. The civilized community loses its importance even if for a short time, and the glory of nature captures you. Mother Nature calls you, and if you learn how to listen, you'll receive your prize: the flow state of mind.",,

"What is creative joy?
I coined this name for a mood or a state of mind you have experienced more than once. Creative joy is the highest vibration you can reach in life. Suppose sadness, shame, or disappointment have the lowest frequencies among all human emotions, and laughter and love have the highest. In that case, the frequency of creative joy is on the same level or even more elevated than love. 
In Creative Joy, your mind knows no barriers and somehow floats higher than all that you used to consider your problems, so you are totally free from negativities like worry, shame, fear, anger, etc. As a result, you feel full of joy, happiness, and extraordinary capability, your every move is spontaneous, and you enjoy each moment ""without any reason."" Your senses and talents are sharper and to the point. In this state, what flashes through your mind will be manifested rapidly.
 Creative Joy is a mind's super arousal condition under subconscious control in which most artistic creations occur. It has been proven beneficial for physical and mental health and is an answer ""from the position of power"" to life!

 Although it occurs spontaneously in times when you fall in love or are super happy because of a success or a great situation, you can also generate it deliberately by doing the following steps:

    Practice putting yourself in a passionate mood about your work/study/loved person or any subject that is dear to you.
    Meditate regularly once or twice a day for at least 10 minutes.
    Surround yourself with a pleasing and calming environment, and choose your sensory input of the highest frequencies, like music, people, places, and whatever you see and hear. For example, following the news, watching murder movies, pass-time with low-frequency people, or being in an unpleasant place kills your Create Joy.
    Receive emotional feedback from one or more person/s who admire you and have the same goals and values that can be a friend or your social media followers or anyone else who has an emotional connection with you.  
    Pay attention to your physical conditions, don‚Äôt abuse your body by consuming too much alcohol or unhealthy foods or drugs or smoking or sitting for hours, and spend time in nature to get inspiration.
    Avoid distraction by unrelated time-consuming activities.",,

"Hello there everyone.
I have previously suffered from depression and recovered somewhat I think i have it again and my husband doesn't let me go to psychiatrist so I can get the right treatment and medication. He is an amazing person but not everyone is equipped to deal with someone who has a mental disorder.

Unfortunately, he does not know how to handle me when I experience the symptoms and just leaves me despite making promises that he will handle me. He has started to get aggressive and spiteful towards me too. Called me a liability. I've tried talking to him, and explaining but he is not listening.. Truth is, I am mentally blocked and cannot do anything other than finding ways to end my life when I have those intense phases. I've hurt myself thrice so far with whatever I had in my hands and I really hope that doesn't happen again. I've promised myself over n over again that I won't do it and I truly don't want to do this but when the phase of sadness and insecurity, vulnerability and apparent disregard comes from my perceived loved ones, it seems impossible to control myself.
Believe me I've tried all these is in the books, deep breathing, meditation, workouts.... Alll there is. 
I don't want to die and leave a mess for my loved ones behind. Can someone please help me and tell me what should I do?

For mental health experts, I am an INFJ on myers briggs test, 29 years old. Recently got married. I don't have any friends. Just my family and this is by choice as i prefer to read books.

In my case it was like a small snowball, getting bigger as years of pain, problems and other things made this snowball so big my mental emotions became a wreck and after a ""work colleague"" became the straw that broke the camel's back, my body couldn' take anymore.

So taking Docs advice, I started going to the gym, possible 6 to 12 months of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and other support has being given.

At first I felt so ashamed that this has happened and it still brings me to tears that I'm stuck in a dark place. Not totally sure what to say but talking to my Doc has put me on a path that I hope will help. Talking could help but we need to have the confidence and courage to take that step.

**So it's been a while since the above post, so I thought it might be worthwhile to give an update.

NHS CBT therapy has been amazing, lots of different techniques in calming the mind and body (this may or may not work for everyone but please try if offered). I've also taken advice from a private trainer (ex military) who has given me a gym workout and diet plan. Also I have removed myself from a toxic working environment and got myself a new job with a different company. 

What can I say.... I feel mentally and physically great. I'm still on medication, still working out at the gym and doing 2 Uni modules while improving my relationship with my wife and family. I'm enjoying the outdoors more by going for long walks and starting to enjoy going camping.

If anyone is in a dark place, shout out and seek help. Don't feel embarrassed or alone.... Please stay safe**",,

Help/ advice needed 

‚ÄúSo basically, a month or so ago, my partners dad died. I won't go into detail but he was a terrible man and he had no relationship with him for at least 11 years for the things his dad has done. When he died though he took it really bad. Lots came out about his dad which made it hard for him to feel like he could openly grieve especially to his family. 

He has been smoking weed which has been so bad for his mental health so just a few weeks ago stopped because we have children and I won't accept that as part of our family. 

2 weeks ago, he went on  week long fishing trip that was a holiday his dad had planned so it was passed on to him. He hated being there and came back even lower than before. 

This is the issue I'm looking for possible answers... 

He has been having pain in his stomach, the hospital said indigestion but he won't believe it. He has other urological problems and but I don't think its connected. When he has had anxiety and the last time he stopped smoking he had the same thing so I believe its the pain is psychological. 

Anyway, after spending 6 hours in hospital, he said as he was driving home, he got to a point where ""he lost it""he remembers thinking about making sure he drives slowly but he cannot remember driving 12 miles of his journey. He said it was like it took 2 seconds. 

Anyway, he past through the next town and said he pulled over and just lost control and just screamed in his car, ""you fxing cnt"" ""why why"" stuff like this. Screamed so much, then said it was like God spoke to him. He couldn't explain it without crying, he wouldn't look at me because he felt I would think he is crazy. He said it wasn't like a voice in his head, but it was overwhelming and he said it was like everything isn't complicated its so simple. He said it was like he heard every thought that anyone who ever existed said in that second. He said loads of other things, but he was so freaked out and he kept crying. None of this was explained to me in the order im explaining to you. 

He said he was also sick, he looked down and it was in his lap but he had no recollection of being sick, he said he thought he died. 

The next day he just said he doesn't want to talk about it because its embarrassing. He even thought maybe it was a seizure but I don't think so. 

Could this be a  dissociative episode? I've heard trauma can cause this but I can't find anything about it. He has been so low until today I called him and he seemed more himself. 

I think coming off smoking has caused some of this as he has always used it to mask his pain so last time he stopped it was 2 weeks of hell! 

Please does anyone had any ideas?? He won't talk to anyone xx‚Äù",,

"I expect you've seen many of posts about the depresion my health causes me but today I'm Just angry, the neurologist I saw 8 years ago diagnosed me with Functional Neurological Disorder kept saying it's psychological caused by stress and if i just believe in the diagnosis I would immediately recover despite it very clearly stating on the NHS FND is a non fatal disorder that is not a mental illness or caused by stress that can cause a wide range of Neurological problems but shows on no test or scans. 

He sent me to several psychologists and psychiatrists trying to get one to diagnose me with a mental illness he could blame it on. But now I found out he must have known the whole time he was saying it's just stress my nerves and brain was inflamed in an ""idiopathic episode"" when I was first went to hospital with the uncontrolled movements and other symptoms and part of my brain had been rendered ""non functioning"". 

I had an emergency appointment about my vision my optician referred me to about the Homonymous hemianopsia I have today and the Dr when diging in my medical records sayings ""it's pointless me being there it's as bad as can be saying I have idiopathic disorder that triggered an episode 8 years ago that caused the optic neuritis along with inflammation of my brain and nervous system that left one side of my occipital lobe permanently non functional causing a complete irreversible Homonymous hemianopsia as I have a brain injury from the episode.

That is a cart load of manure right there as clearly something must have been shown on tests or scans the neurolgist saw for today's doctor to know about the inflamation and damage to my occipital lobe which I knew nothing about. I'm still officially diagnosed with FND but now I don't know if something else wrong on top of what I know or I've been midiagnosed due to a truly incompetent neurolgist and other doctors not willing to investigate because of the idiopathic and FND diagnosis.",,

The answers the person gave to his fan was - ""i think that you should live your one life for yourself. within reason, you should do what you want to do."" 

This exchange hit too close to home since that's exactly my situation. Even after graduating university of what my parents (specially what my mom wanted which was languages since my dad's wish of engineering or law or anything like that was too difficult for me because I really struggled with that kind of sciences) wanted they're still not satisfied since I can't find a job with my degree or anywhere else (in my country it was difficult situation with employment as it was and COVID really made it almost impossible for young people to find a job or for someone to find different job) even though my mom tries to understand but still they would never let me continue dancing that I had to quit because of them and as they said it's enough to spend my time doing nonsense and focus and studies and get a real job that would pay my bills not just some BS - that was their wordsüòî  and even though I've been dancing since childhood for many years professionally it's been almost 10 years since I was forced to stop dancing and it's been a hell of the time with mental health hitting the rock bottom, getting help and getting on medication that made me gain weight, then spending almost last two years after uni trying to focus on my health and on top of that through those years I lost my physical form and stamina since I didn't keep up or workout and now I'm 25 struggling to find a job (now I have one but it's a temporary one for 2 months but still it's better than nothing) still struggling with my mental health which is really a journey where some days I'm doing better and other days I wonder why I was born at all... it feels like I'm completely lost with no knowledge or plan of where to go or what I'm doing and what is my purpose and with the biggest regret of my life of leaving my one true love my one dream and passion which is dance and everything makes me think it's too late to pick up dancing again since I'm 25 and it will almost be as starting from zero (even though muscle memory it's still there I'm sure if I would be able to tap into it) and with nothing guaranteed what will happen üòî",,

I may be biased but this is a truly honest and heart-felt account and will no doubt inspire others and help them realise there is always a way through the darkness. This book is proof of that.

"""The pain of doing nothing is far worse than the pain of doing something"". 

It's a bit like the thought of losing weight when your fearful of training, putting in the hours, grafting, experiencing the pain of applying effort and dedication. By doing nothing, remaining unfit, feeling fat, languished and depressed because your not getting on with it can be far, far worse on your mental health.

This applies to everything in life and everything you want to achieve. You'd be better off attacking your goals than doing nothing and feeling worse. Break the cycle.

What should you be doing? What are you fearing? What would you like to achieve? 

Time to start 'doing' instead of doing nothing.

"Can you help us make a difference locally? We need your support.

MindFixers is a not-for-profit organisation in Littlehampton, West Sussex created to provide low cost, quick and top quality solution for those seeking therapy and coaching. Part of the MindFixers solution is to provide a 12 hour programme spread over 6-8 weeks which is accessible to anyone and provides therapy and coaching for almost all common mental health issues.

The cost of an hour‚Äôs session is around 80% less than the average hourly rate for private therapy (and can often be free of charge). Accessibility is the key and MindFixers will enable thousands of people who would otherwise be denied therapy the ability to fix their mental issues, fast, quickly and expertly.

MindFixers has a dedicated mission: to enable each and every one of our clients to become an ‚Äòinformal coach‚Äô. What does this mean? The Programme will not only provide excellent therapy and a new way of thinking, but will also empower, provide much needed knowledge, enabling our clients to listen more intently, to avoid judgement and to encourage those in their peer groups to open up and talk. In essence, the mission of MindFixers is to influence as many people as possible to feel the freedom of being able to talk openly to their trusted peers. We believe the effect of this will begin to make a positive impact on society‚Äôs mental health issues and reverse the current upward trend of these issues as a whole.

Our main aims are;

‚Ä¢ Provide socially inclusive therapy and coaching for all by making accessible.

‚Ä¢ Reduce the stigma associated to mental health whilst empowering our clients with the knowledge to ‚Äòpass it on'.

‚Ä¢ Reduce the time it takes to access therapy and coaching when its needed most.

‚Ä¢ Provide support for other much needed projects within the local community through localism.

For more information about MindFixers please go to our website at http://www.mindfixers.co.uk.

All donations will help make a huge impact on those that suffer the effects of poor mental health. (See the campaign at https://www.gofundme.com/f/walkandtalkcampaign). 

For the second year Steve McKeown, Personal Trainer Phil Burman, drummer Charlie Stanley from The Ordinary Boys and several other celebrities are walking from Eastbourne to Winchester, with several stops along the way including Petersfield, between 3rd and 6th April 2020 to offer support on the move and to raise funds for excellent Sussex-based causes as well as awareness for the growing mental health epidemic we are currently facing.

As in 2019, this is no ordinary walk because Steve and his team will be inviting people and celebrities to walk and talk about their own mental health issues, providing therapy and support along the way, making it available for those that need it most and for as far as their feet will take them.

""Our primary aim is to help remove the stigma associated with mental health and talking about it. Nobody should ever feel alone and isolated. We feel that fundraising for MindFixers and BHCT is the best place to start"", stated Steve.",,
"I am now excepting new video and telephone clients.

If you have an issue that is impacting your life and affecting your mental health or you simply want to improve the way you think and sharpen up. Give me a call for a free confidential chat.

Put 'you' first.

"Hi all,

For the last 3 months or so I have been asking the same question(s) day in, day out, no graphics, nothing other than words asking a questions. No long drawn out text to read, just straight to the point. I'm not here for the vanity other than to help in any way that I can. That's me. It's my life and its fortunately my career.

The most common questions I ask are;

""How has your day been?"" 

""How are you feeling tonight?"", 

""What's your day been like today?"".

They are all very simple questions, distractions away from normal life, reaching out. I try to answer every comment to show I am listening. I am here.

Everyone can do this, everyone has the same capacity to reach out. I've had some wonderful comments of reply, which I am so grateful of.

The moral behind my questioning is; if everyone asked similar questions we'd be much closer, much more integrated as a community. Maybe in your own way. That's not saying you can't be elaborate with graphics etc but keep it straight to the point.

Social media shouldn't just be about telling stories, the perfect snapshot of your life and many other scenarios. It's also about caring. 

As we become further disconnected to reallity and spend more time on communication tools such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc we need to learn how to demonstrate how we communicate in an entirely different way. Lockdown has been tough on everyone, isolation, loneliness, increased stress, mental health issues.

I now ask everyone to do the same, not necessarily a single post but maybe just a comment on someone else's wall.

You could make someone else's day!

"I've recently been interested in earthing or what's also known as grounding. It's quite simple, you earth your bed via a copper conduit rod hammered into the soil, run a conduit cable from the rod to your bedroom, connect the cable to the mattress via aluminium tape. I've tested connectivity via a multimeter and hey presto it's working. I am now ready to test the benefits. 

The health benefits of being grounded are phenomenal. Studies have shown that it can help with sleep, pain, cortisol levels, anxiety, depression and many other complaints. I thought I give it go as part of my research.

There are many scientific research studies that suggest that grounding is a real science. 

If your interested please watch the following documentary. I will update you on any progress.

MINDFIXERS - is a not-for-profit organisation created to provide a cheap, quick and top quality solution for those seeking therapy. Part of the MindFixers solution, MindFixers Programme, is a 12 hour programme spread over 6 weeks which is accessible by anyone and provides therapy for almost any mental condition.

The cost of an hour‚Äôs session is around 80% less than the average hourly rate for private therapy (and can often be free of charge). Accessibility is the key and MindFixers will enable thousands of people who would otherwise be denied therapy the ability to fix their mental issues, fast, quickly and expertly.

BEACHY HEAD CHAPLAINCY - is a valued search and rescue charity that seeks to save lives at Beachy Head, East Sussex.

The chaplains patrol on foot and by car and respond to emergency calls locating anyone at risk.

Using their skills in crisis intervention, they offer supportive listening to start a dialogue and to encourage more hopeful solutions than suicide.

They work alongside local services helping people to access support. 

PAVILLIONS - provides drug and alcohol services for adults in Brighton & Hove.
 
Support is available to anyone concerned about their drug or alcohol use, or to the families and carers supporting those struggling with substance misuse, irrespective of age, gender, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status or HIV status.

It is not that he does not have the ability because it is stuff that he knows. I have tried everything i can think of but nothing works.

We have seen adults and children suffering from ADHD benefit tremendously from hemp oil, this is the first safe, organically grown, batch controlled, cold pressed and legal oil brought to South Africa which has been tested extensively that has none of the psychoactive ingredients of cannabis and totally safe to give to your children and to use yourself. Please let me know if you are interested to read more about the product, or would like to come to a meeting.","Yes Adrian Matthew we have already seen how amazing this oil is for ADHD! I have seen it work miracles on kids that had no focus and the ability to concentrate. It has none of the negative effects that canabis oil and THC has.  Please go to www.canamere.com/duplooy to read what this can do for you and your family! If you have any questions please let me know, or better yet join us for the next meeting","Thanks Cindy Du Plooy, I will check it out. Adrian Adrian Matthew From what I have learnt so far (I admit I am no scientist), hempseed oil is a great nutritional boost with the biggest value being attributed to easily absorbed Omega 3-I do feel better when drinking Biogen Omega 3 capsules up to 5000mg per day spread out, but more generally speaking hemp oil with CBD and THC (pure cannabis oil) is medicinally superior. The hempseed used for making legal oil do come from industrial application plants that have lower of those qualities and so I wonder if one should then take a lot more to have the medicinal effect it can offer. The problem with that is that the plant is a bio-accumulator which means that heavy metals are taken in by the plant while growing. As a lot of plant material is needed to make the oil, the additional elements are then also more concentrated than perhaps desired. The process of then 'purifying' the oil of said elements to safe numbers becomes an avenue worth scientifically investigated and I definately am trying. I was diagnosed with another condition recently that also affects memory so I am so confused about pretty much all of my symptoms. Until then, Concerta is definately not going anywhere and I will keep on emptying my pocket each month for my prescription!"

"Dear Parents 

 

Concentration is the master skill that affects everything that we do.  

 

The ability to concentrate is a secret element to success that often gets ignored. According to Daniel Goleman it is more important than IQ for determining school and career success.  

Within the context of school and university learners are required to concentrate and apply themselves in order to achieve results. Learners who are distracted and who are unable to bring their brains into focus usually struggle to reach their full potential.  

You can give your child an added advantage through neurofeedback training.  

 

The Brain 

The circuitry to concentrate is found in the area of the brain that governs executive functioning - the pre-frontal cortex. The attentional circuitry needs to have the experience of sustained episodes of concentration in order to build the mental models that create someone who can concentrate and perform optimally. In other words, we need to train the brain to increase concentration levels required to improve cognitive ability and keep it at enhanced levels for longer.  

 

Neurofeedback training 

Neurofeedback training uses cutting edge technology and it is non-invasive, drug free, safe and globally supported by extensive peer-reviewed literature. Research has proven that by increasing brain blood flow, significant clinical benefits are realised for many types of learning, cognitive, behaviour and neurological disorders. Because neurofeedback training positively impacts the frontal lobe, it can also provide for peak performance in sport and the corporate environment.   

Neurofeedback training enables the brain to actually growadditional cells and modify the functioning of existing cells. It does this through biofeedback training sessions. Just as a heart rate monitor assists you to train for fitness, so neurofeedback assists you to train your brain.  Through neurofeedback training, the brain creates additional neuropathways that assist with concentration, higher order thinking, decision making and behaviour regulation. In summary, by increasing blood flow to the frontal lobe, the brain is able to positively alter its structure.  

 

Who benefits from neurofeedback training? 

Every single person can benefit from neurofeedback training. In an age of distraction where our emotions are often scattered and our minds race from one thing to another we need to learn and practice concentration skills and strategies. We need to train our brains to be present and to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant. Neurofeedback training is for anyone who wants: 

‚Ä¢ Better concentration skills 
‚Ä¢ Higher productivity 
‚Ä¢ Improved cognitive functioning 
‚Ä¢ Mindfulness 
 

How do we operate? 

We assess learners on the TESCA (Test of Emotional Stability and Cognitive Ability).  The assessment will provide insight into your child‚Äôs concentration skills. It will measure: 

‚Ä¢ Attention 
‚Ä¢ Impulsivity 
‚Ä¢ Accuracy 
‚Ä¢ Response time 
‚Ä¢ Variability 
These variables are used worldwide in scientific studies to measure cognitive performance.  

Where fallouts in concentration are noted a training protocol will be prescribed and where learners may benefit from peak performance training, such a training protocol will also be suggested. 

Should you wish to assist your child in harnessing their full potential, we encourage you to become involved in the exciting world of Neurofeedback training. 

We look forward to working with you and your child to achieve excellence.

"Good Morning Everyone.

First time in a long time I feel amazing. I think the meds are starting to take effect. I use to feel like I was never really present, like me life was out of focus constantly. I lived more in my thoughts than living life because my mind just never went quiet. I always felt tired, when I went to bed it was as if I'm half a awake the whole time, I wouldn't even dream for months on end. Resulting in me feeling constantly exhausted.

Since I started my meds I've been feeling more awake and this morning I feel here. My mind feels clearer than it has felt for a long time. Its like I've had really poor eye sight for a long time and finally got my Specs this morning. I just pray this is how it will always be when i'm on my meds and that I'm not just on some kind of temporary high. :-).

I hope you all are having better days since you have been diagnosed. I use to think I was just super lazy and weird and messed up, but since I've been diagnosed I feel understood and 'saved' in a sense.

So if you are having a bad day today, please know it wont always be that way and know there is hope whether with natural remedies or meds. Just stay hopeful and positive. Love you all and wishing you an amazing day.",What meds are you on?,

What‚Äôll be the most affordable route of getting diagnosed as an adult? How does it work? How many sessions does one need & Does it really change anything if you do get diagnosed, if so - how, I mean is it really worth the time, effort and money?

* I‚Äôm always late & miss deadlines and I hate it! Despite trying to plan accordingly.
* I procrastinate and leave everything to 99, get stressed and do a weeks worth of work in 1 evening.. obviously causing careless mistakes.
* I struggle to keep a set schedule
* Spaces out in conversations.
* I‚Äôm highly irritable and tend to react before I think..
* I always feel restless and on edge.

* Can‚Äôt stay committed to a hobby. 
* Annoyingly disorganised 
* Low selfesteem.
* excessive talker & fidgeting, but I don‚Äôt easily connect with people.

"Please may you give me some advice. 
My kid recently diagnosed with Adhd combination. She Ôøºwas put on 5mg Ritalin for a month then the dr changed it to Neucon. I have no clue why. 
She is terrible on Neucon extremely emotional and not eating. 
She has only had 16 tablets of the Neucon so far, 
The Dr has now said let‚Äôs go back to 5mg Ritalin. 
My question is, is there a difference difference behaviour in short or LA Ritalin, he said we can look at LA later due to she sensitivity to the medication.  ÔøºI am feeling extremely confused and the Dr and pharmaceutical companies keep getting richer. 

I have to pay for a new script everytime and see the Dr every 4 months.","Natural Medication was a huge step for us. With hindsight I probably should have been braver and started it sooner. I can honestly say it's been life changing for my boy and us as a family. He's far, far happier and copes so much better on meds. We use high quality Broad-Spectrum oil drops which is a game changer. It took us a couple of days to get the Order and product information containing dosage was sent alongside. We stuck with it and I'm so glad we did. He's gone from being a sad lonely and very angry boy, to coping in school, improved focus which helps with concentration, having a small group of loyal friends and actually getting some enjoyment out of life. He sleeps better now and eats like a champ.
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't solve everything but it certainly has made life a whole lot more bearable and we don't get the huge meltdowns any more. He's in year 8 now and school have commented on how well he's doing. So far I'm struggling to see a down side. Reach out to health_space_247 in Insta, we get the best ones health related advice and recommendations from them. x",My girl didn't do well with the Ritalin and we are now on Concerta.... Long acting.... It's great

We not sure what is going on and we as parents is so worried they say he can not complete a task in class he is all over the place talk all the time . We know he is a.very busy busy child but we tough it is normal as we always here boys is busy they will grow out of it. Is there any one who could maybe give me advice,"He's 5, he is not supposed to be able to sit still for a long time!

"Went to see a psychologist today. She disturbs my explanation by always saying ""everybody goes through that"" and she explains something so long that I end up zoning out while she's explaining. And I still leave feeling misunderstood. That's why I don't like going to psychologists. And I need help, as I'm not coping....  I feel so frustrated!!!

"When you have a ""normal"" child, who gets good grades, you are happy. When he or she does as they are told, you are happy. But it is a ""normal"" joy, because, of course, it is his/her duty. But when you have a child with some limitations, with each learning and small success, you pulsate and vibrate as if you had won a championship... I would like to ask you a great favor on an important subject:
It is the Special Education week, for children with Cerebral Palsy, Down syndrome, Autism, Dyslexia, ADHD (attention deficit, with and without hyperactivity). For all children with special needs who struggle every day to succeed, and those who try to help them.
It would be great to teach our children to be kind and to accept all their classmates. Children with special needs are not strangers. They want what every kid wants: to be accepted! And they suffer greatly when they are rejected or mocked.
Can I make you a request? Copy and paste this message in honor of all children who are UNIQUE, but different! Let's see who has a strong heart? Please do not share. Copy and paste. Believe it or not, special children and their parents need lots of help!",,

I worry about everything all the time
Sometimes I forget to call her 
Not that I want to because to
My mind feels like a Child locked in a Crazy store warehouse without cameras
I have a diary which I forget where it is.
I'm organised in a mess 24 hrs
I love me so much the same way I hate my mistakes.
I think in high frequency like a super car on a freeway my thought is unstoppable
I fight my thoughts all the time
I want to be alone with everybody around me.
When I hurt I cry even in public
Suicidal but rich in life
I know everything but hard to use
The same knowledge
Im the guy whom plays with the dog at an invited party
I lose stuff all the time
Dammit where's my wallet again mxm
I want to dance wait no actually scream maybe while dancing mix it up with some laughter then let me cry while at it.
I'm paranoid about the future past and present
Let me fidget till I can't feel my hands
Let me fidget till my knee is numb
Just spilt a drink on My white pants as I type this.
Don't scream or call me crazy 
Cause this is my blessing and my curse.",One day he will understand,Gosh this is so beautifully written.

Any suggestion to natural suplement to boost serotonin?,,
"As a Neurofeedback Practitioner, I am always stunned by the number of Grade 1 parents contacting us for help early in their child‚Äôs grade 1 year. So many of the parents tell us that the teachers identified that the child cannot concentrate. When asked, more often than not, parents indicate that a lack of concentration was never an issue before. So why now?

In South Africa, by law, children should go to Grade 1 the year in which they turn seven ‚Äì thus creating the impression that age determines school readiness. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as that! We should not only gauge a child‚Äôs readiness for school by his or her age. Children vary greatly in their levels of emotional maturity. This is partly influenced by parenting but also depends on the natural, biological developmental process and the environmental stimulus. Therefore, the child‚Äôs overall development should be considered. Some developmental milestones are easy to observe, but others are much more subtle. Undetected, these underdeveloped skills could lead to academic and social issues later in the child‚Äôs school.

So, what should we consider?
When we talk about development, we should look at the different aspects thereof:

emotional
social
physical
intellectual
language development
These are broad terms‚Ä¶ not always easily observed and understood. Let me break it down for you, identifying a few traits to look out for:

Confidence. Is your child confident enough to speak up when he/she is uncomfortable or needs help? In the daunting larger Grade 1 environment, children need to be able to let the teacher know when they need a bathroom break, are feeling ill, do not have the right tools or are being bullied.

ÔÇß Separation. Drama dropping off your child at school? Some crying in the first few weeks is normal. However, teachers simply don‚Äôt have the capacity to console a tearful child all day long. Sitting next to your child in the grade 1 class during school hours should not be an option.

ÔÇß Responsibility. Can your child look after his/her ‚Äòstuff‚Äô? Do lunchboxes come back home at the end of the day, or do you need to buy new ones on a weekly basis?

ÔÇß Concentration. Oh! This one is a tough one! Is your child able to sit still, at a table and concentrate for relatively long periods at a time? Remember in nursery school children move a lot! A grade 1 child is expected to sit still and work ‚Äì a lot!

ÔÇß Problem solving. Can your child solve little problems as the day goes on? Forgot a ruler ‚Äì borrow one; lost a school jersey ‚Äì go to the lost property box.

ÔÇß Independence. Can your child complete most tasks on his/her own or is he/she constantly running to his teacher‚Äôs table for approval or intervention?

ÔÇß Persistence. Is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù the norm with your child?

A School Readiness Assessment provides a baseline of your child's current level of ability in the specific areas which equips them to cope with formal learning situations. It is therefore invaluable to you as the parent and to your child's teacher, regarding their strengths and the areas in which attention is still required before they make the transition to Grade 1.

Brain Gain is equipped and geared to provide parents with a unique School Readiness Assessment which evaluates the child's cognitive and physical development, as well as his/her ability to concentrate. When the assessment highlights areas of concern, parents receive a customised activity pack which can be used at home with your child to have fun practicing skills to develop the problem areas.",Do you accept medical aid?,

"17 Things Your ADHD Child Would Tell You if He Could

1) I'm trying way harder than you‚Äôll ever know even though it doesn‚Äôt seem like it to you. I really, truly am.

2) Criticizing me or getting angry at me that my brain doesn‚Äôt work better doesn‚Äôt help me. It makes me hate myself even more.

3) I‚Äôm painfully aware of all the areas that I‚Äôm not measuring up. Instead of making a big deal about my shortcomings, try to find ways to help me.

4) An accommodation isn‚Äôt the same as enabling. If you help me where I‚Äôm genuinely struggling, I‚Äôm going to be grateful. Don‚Äôt assume that I‚Äôm manipulating you.

5) I‚Äôm not doing this to you; it‚Äôs not something I am doing on purpose.

6) If you think it‚Äôs hard to live with me, imagine trying to live inside a body that won‚Äôt do what you want it to do.

7) My brain doesn‚Äôt work right but I don‚Äôt know how to tell you that. It makes me angry and unkind, but I‚Äôm not trying to be that way.

8) When I‚Äôm being horrible, what I really need is for you to tell me you‚Äôll love me no matter what. And maybe hug me, too. I probably believe that I‚Äôm unlovable, so prove me wrong.

9) I know that my lack of motivation is frustrating, but pushing harder doesn‚Äôt help me do better.

10) My anger and frustration is a result of my brain not processing properly. When I‚Äôm overwhelmed and freaking out, don‚Äôt escalate by freaking out or getting angry too. I need you to be calm and show me that everything‚Äôs going to be fine even when I feel like it‚Äôs not.

11) If I get overwhelmed, don‚Äôt expect me to sort out the problem all by myself. The part of my brain the controls regulation doesn‚Äôt work properly. That‚Äôs why I need your help to regulate.

12) Don‚Äôt try to break me of things that you see as weaknesses. My sensitivity as a child means I‚Äôll be compassionate as an adult. My stubbornness as a child means I‚Äôll be independent and assertive as an adult. Instead of squashing these characteristics, channel them toward something good that can benefit me when I‚Äôm older. Don‚Äôt view me as something that needs fixed or toughened-up.

13) Don‚Äôt be afraid of labeling me. A label gives me answers and help. If my condition is serious enough to need to be diagnosed, you can guarantee that I‚Äôve noticed something‚Äôs wrong and I‚Äôm wondering why I‚Äôm different too. Unless you tell me what‚Äôs going on, I‚Äôm likely to grow up angry and confused about why everyone has it all together and I don‚Äôt. A label means I can get help; it gives me answers and vindication.

14) I have a real, actual medical condition in my brain. It‚Äôs just as real as if I had Type 1 Diabetes. Just like Diabetes, I need help to deal with the condition. No one tells someone with Type 1 Diabetes that they are lazy if they‚Äôre tired because their blood sugar is low. They understand that it‚Äôs part of the condition. Please, please, please learn about my condition, and don‚Äôt blame me for things that are out of my control. Just like leaving Type 1 Diabetes untreated results in serious complications and even death, untreated ADHD can lead to serious complications ‚Äìpotentially including death. Thankfully, there are many ways to treat ADHD (and medication isn‚Äôt the only way).

15) My frontal lobe is developing 30% behind normal. Please understand this and don‚Äôt put me in situations I‚Äôm not ready to handle. If you give me responsibility that‚Äôs beyond my developmental age, don‚Äôt be angry with me that I do poorly. That‚Äôs setting me up for failure, and that‚Äôs just cruel.

16) Stop expecting me to be normal. I can‚Äôt be. Not for all my trying. Until you accept that, I‚Äôll always be a failure in your eyes, and I‚Äôll always view myself as not good enough.

17) You have the power to make me miserable by how you treat me. Remember to treat me with love and grace. Treat me how you would want to be treated if you were struggling with a problem in your brain. I may make myself miserable sometimes, but don‚Äôt add to that by treating me poorly. When in doubt, be kind. Believe me, I need your kindness.",Love this. Well written.,üò≠üò≠
