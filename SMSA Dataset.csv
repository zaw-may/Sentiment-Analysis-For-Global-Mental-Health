I feel like I’m a burden to everybody  bothering people with my problems & my existence. Moving to a different city & changing my number have been heavy on my mind.,Best to talk to a therapist. It's too much for family and friends,"I hear you.... I do. I want to do the same sometimes. But then I watch people and see who they are because I know I have a mental issue and I know my brain lies to me... Look around you.... Some people really do care.

Maybe go to weekly mind meetings in the UK or groups local to you who all feel the same xxx"
This is what I'll be doing on Christmas. I just do not feel well. I just do not have it in me to fight  I've been doing it for 55 years. I'm just worn out. I do hope your Christmas will be better.,Give yourself a break from your negative thoughts. This is the day  the king is born.,Same here. I know how you feel
Bye big hugs blessed be judge me all you want don't care.  After tonight my spouse thinks he's so wonderful well let's me make it real!!,I'm okay but mentally I'm not and I'm done putting up with all this...i will be okay when I disappear not dead just gone!! I've seriously had enough.  Thank you all for caring I do greatly appreciate it more than I can even express!,Are you OK?
I know this may be deemed a silly question but it's in my nature to ask  how is everyone feeling? Let's start a discussion.,Restless. I personally think there's something else going on.,"I agree it's so hard to know what to know what to believe. The media have reputation of skewing the truth by means of escalating small amounts of truth. My best guess is to focus on multi-platform news like LBC radio. This essentially provides a balance view. Anyhow, the more we communicate with each other the better. This also provides the opportunity to gain a balanced view. Let's support each other through this. :)"

"As I type this slowly from my hospital bed. I suffer from depression and anxiety for over 26 years. In September I caught a cold. Though it was bronchitis, also during this time my physician has me on thyroid meds I don't need. Which in turns sends me into go get a bunch of tests done. Well quess what thyroid was just fine. This was NNovember15. November 19 I end up in the er. Can't walk, slurred speech, and numbing on my left side of my face. I have the ct scans,labs,mri. They can't find anything, so they just say follow up with your doctor. The soonest I could get in was Dec 8th. My doctor then diagnosed me with viral encephalitis. No test to confirm that was it. Starts me on anti-virus meds, and then weeks later steroids. I bring to January 10th back in er. I look like I had a stroke!!! It's time to do a spinal tap and a full mri!

Guess who's labs came clean and mri. Neurologist told that the depression and anxiety took my brain. It was like the check engine light was flashing, and I didn't see it. So now I have to lean how to walk again,talk,you know the simple things in life. I will never be the same person again. And I have to cope with that. But I hope sharing my story with you all helps someone else that feels lost.",Sounds very much like conversion disorder. I hope you get well soon...,"!!!UPDATE!!!
I am out of the hospital and at home. I have outpatient pt/ot scheduled to help with my symptoms. But at least I am home and I can have my support animals back. Thank you everyone for your kindness and advice. And also thank you for welcoming me to the group!"
"Worried about panic attacks, not sleeping?  Post your questions below.","Hi, I'm a bit worried going back to Tesco's, had a full blown panic attack in there Monday! Now normally I work my way through them & I can normally get it to stop,didn't work this time, staff in there know me & it was embarrassing, sweats,breathing & being able to walk all went, how do I know that isn't going to happen every time I go I there?","& sleeping is just out of the question, struggle the best of times !

"I'm pissed off right now it's unreal, about a few hours ago i posted a meme into one of the groups I'm in its a gen x group i found the meme in my other gen x anyway some1 from the gen x group where I posted the meme called me racist 😡 I'm like wtf 😡 the meme wasn't racist but this person tried to rip into me for being racist which I'm not it's not the first time this has happened and i guess it won't be the last, the last time I was called racist was bk in 2022 these people were talking about race all i said was when i was younger where I lived we had people of colour but now we don't and I went on saying that i miss those days ( nothing racist about that comment ) yet i get called racist what made it worse was the admin and mods and even the members knew it wasn't racist but sided with the person who called me racist ( this was the group bk 2022 ) months later i found out why i was kicked and blocked from the group was because the owner of the group was best friends with the person who called me racist 😡 i don't have a racist bone in body and that's why I'm pissed off 😡","Just put plain jokes online, no connections to anything then.

"Just wanted to say you not alone and my inbox is always open if you struggle or just want to vent 
I struggle myself I know how it's feels when you have no one to talk.","I once believed that my beloved spouse was the epitome of perfection. Little did I know, beneath her charismatic facade, she was a master manipulator, distorting reality to satisfy her own selfish desires. Lost and disoriented, I desperately yearnedfor a glimpse of the truth. Then, by chance, I stumbled upon a mysterious expert online. Desperate for answers, I sought out his assistance, and it turned out to be a life-changing revelation! With his unmatched skills, he fearlessly delved into the intricate web of deceit, monitoring my wife's actions through her phone and covertly examining her WhatsApp conversations. That was the moment when my world crumbled. I discovered that my beloved wife had been secretly meeting with young individuals, betraying me without remorse. The anguish I felt was indescribable, amplified by the realization of the abuse and silent suffering I had endured. It was a harsh awakening that left me shattered. But I refuse to let this story end in despair. As a survivor of such treacherous depths, I urge you, esteemed reader, to pay heed to my narrative. Countless individuals find themselves trapped in similar webs of deception, living in the shadows of manipulative narcissists. That is why I wholeheartedly recommend the elusive guru who unraveled my truth. If you too desire to reclaim your reality, don't hesitate to reach out to him. The key to liberation is within your grasp. Connect with him on his Facebook page, 👉 Sift Forensics and embrace the power of truth to break free from the clutches of deception.

Having such a hard time. I'm done.,Be strong. You've made it so far. We're here to support you as well. You've got this ❤️,💕🙏💕
It is good that I have a very good friend and also 1 group in Histon and the other in Cambridge but they don't get back until the 7th and the 8th of next month but it is good that I have a dog as they never let u down,"Dogs are the best!

"Aside from breathing, meditation, journaling and ultimately a benzo which I hate to rely on, is there any holistic gummy or non addictive substance that soothes. I’m going through hell on this earth and so tired of waiting for CBT and meds to get straightened out. I don’t sleep and I can’t take it.",Substances are only bandaids Sadly... You want to Get out of Your Hell... Then You have to Face your fears and The trauma That began Your Suffering 🙏. It'll be worth it in the end... Just remember there is nothing wrong with you and your not broken despite what society says... You always have been perfect as you are x,🤔 have you tried putting a Bluetooth speaker next to your bed and through your phone using sleep meditation music?
"Guys, I'm not just tired but exhausted & am honestly on the verge of giving up all together but my babies are my entire universe & more so I'm seriously trying my best to keep trying & swallow my pride no matter how bad I don't want to..I gotta remember it's for my babies & if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be putting my pride aside to get some help. We're barely able to eat let alone keep our blankets & stuff as clean & okay as I can. 

I'm making this post to hopefully get anyone & everyone to send my babies & I all the good vibes, prayers, whatever it is you do, please send them all my way. I've been doing my best to get us off the streets & it's been so much harder than I ever thought possible. Everything is always full or out of funds or just can't help & I'm going insane sleeping outside with my 4 & 2 year olds. I'm SO INSANELY close to getting us a room for a month with actual beds & clean blankets, & a bathroom which I have missed so so much & will never take it for granted ever again!! & to top it all off my beautiful mama's parkinsons is progressing so fast for her. 

Sorry for the rant guys and pretty please don't forget to send any good vibes or prayers for us to get the room asap or even some food, diapers, & wipes ♡♡♡",Whereabouts are you?,🙏🏻
I'm in so much pain can somebody just reach out.😭😭,I’m here for ya & up right now,🙏🙏🙏
"Its urgent. Im not feeling well. I had mild depression for a week now. But now it is a full blown major depressive episode. It all precipitated when i asked my newly married sister, who i am very close with, that i wanted to visit her and idk she didnt sound very eager to welcome me (or atleast thats what i perceived). I hung up and I stopped answering her calls and messages. I dont feel good at all. I have nobody to talk to.",I think the answer is within your own Words... As you know we all have Our own problems going on and maybe they have their own also and Are thinking of you and if you visiting would make you feel worse... Talk to them stop avoiding them if you want to feel better,"1. Once married things are different. 
2. Her lack of eagerness could be because of other issues irrelevant to you.
3. What if you talked to her and asked if she had a problem or something going on."
"I need advice 

Befofe you accuse me of me being gross accuse past me cause I lost touch with this person for two years now but I can’t help but think back on it cause it was such a silly and possibly disgusting thing 

So two years ago I was friends with someone on discord 

We originally met on messenger with our bond over anime 

She was 17 and I was 25 and you do the math of how old we are today 

Eventually our friendship grew strong before the fall 

But the age difference was very off putting not just number but mind wise 

Yes we’d have fun having discord watches with watching animes and cartoons cuz we bond over those but yet we’d fight a lot 

I still cant believe up to this day I was friends with a minor… 

Was I gross and disgusting committing this act? 

Be real 

Cause like I wanna know 

I think I was 

But I’m curious what other people think 

Like there was nothing innapropriate we were just silly and bonding over anime and cartoons",So this person was a friend no big deal wot so ever,10 year's up 10 year's down is my limit  but we are all different and should make our own rules so what i say is not what you say so 95 year old and 15 year old is correct to what they say . It is what it is ok 👍  👌
,Mint 👌😉💪🙏😇,13yr pushing buttons but thankfully me and hubby are a partnership when it comes to one of our kids having a melt down. I can remember how frustrating it can be at that age. She has the gift of the gab like me but wow she’s so much smarter than me. But not the life expectancies. She’s lost her electrical till Monday. But all good here 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️😂
Have you ever been in one of those moods where you just want to grab everything and rip it from the walls and break everything because you feel broken and you want to scream and kick and cry because nothing feels right and it’s all wrong and you don’t feel right and I don’t know. Yep,I have in the position when I am crying out for help and no one was listening I felt all alone in a desert screaming as loud as I can  I finally got someone to hear me I feel cautious but I am getting hesrd,24/7
"New to group, been struggling for a while with family,but this week had emergency visit south to see family, then 24hrs later my kitten got hot by car outside of vet hours,hebis ok , had surgery today, saved his leg, have last minute psychology appointment with waited a year for as they phoned yesturday and offered for today sonot going to turn it down, went better than expected but im on edge, fight or flight and struggling,  tonight asked husband to cuddle me on sofa and i just cried",You sound like you have a good supportive husband you sound overwhelmed it’s time for you to take time for yourself what do you like to do? It can be anything something small I like to color with gel pens this keeps focus and calm and my anxiety at a low level,"A cuddle helps so much!!!!
At least you have that
I try hard to find the hood and happy things to dwell on it helps
A walk by water or in the wind too helps me
I have bad bad days I stay in bed but I try to seek happiness
I smile at passers by
That’s a good thing they usually smile back

"I’m really struggling with my mental health right now. I find it hard to open up to anyone. I’ve tried in the past and been told that im strong enough to cope with anything or just blatantly shut down and told im being stupid and to get over it. Im alway there for everyone but it feels like I have no one there for me. I feel like im going to explode, it’s the last thing I want to do. I’ve been holding things in for so long now. The thing is, I don’t even know why im feeling like this so I don’t know what I need to fix to make it all better and go away. How can I feel this low and not even know why? Im so tired.",Hey,A day survived is a day closer to survival
"So I get to speak to a new doctor tomorrow and I am hoping they listen. I was told I have BPD aswell as a whole bunch of other stuff but I think it's something different like bipolar. 
There is no medium with me. I am extremely high and then extremely low. I get very defensive when I am high which is a natural reaction I have. My other problem is alcohol because I have used it as a coping mechanism and it has destroyed me in the process. I am going to ask for medication for that too. If I had money I would walk away from the life I have now and hope that a fresh start would help me be better and save the heartache I cause to those around me. But that isn't the answer.","Have you tried AA groups? It could help with the alcohol and maybe help with symptoms from the mental health diagnosis. I have known a lot of people in recovery that created new beautiful lives through that program. But it takes time, effort, consistency, etc. Wishing you well my friend. 🙏🙏🌷🌷","A diagnosis is a good start and at least get you with people at some point, if you think diagnosis doesn't quite fit find the one that will listen but definitely get heard."
A great way to help with your mental health is to close your eyes and imagine you’re at the beach. The skies are beautiful. The wind is calm and the waves are soothing to you.,"I do this when it's sunny out. Lol 
People think I'm crazy. Oh well.",A good tip. Mindful visualisation with use of the senses :-)
,I was in your place a long time ago all I can say God was watching over me and he is watching over you it took a lot of therapy a lot of tears it has been a long road but guess what it got better it doesn’t seem like that now but you will too get people around you family or friends that will support you,A lot of good causes out there to help others
"Mom here of a 25 Bipolar son, he has been hospitalized since Saturday after a car accident due to drugs and manic episode.  

Got a call today from nurse. Asking me questions regarding my son's mental health history.  
One question or comment upset me. 

She asked if my son was abused, he claimed he was abused by me physically.  I started to cry, it broke my heart to think his mind is so sick righr now that he is accusing me of abuse. 
I never abused my son, me turning off the wi-fi was the worse thing I have ever done. He never gave me a reason to hit him or even yell at him till he was abour 17 yrs old. 

My heart hurts for him and i am sad 😔","Ehh 
In some cases people can imagine things that are not real. Can even place them precisely in their lifetime.
You know that you did no wrong to him. Just stay strong and keep trying to help your son. 
I strongly believe that everything will be fine eventually:) 
Yes it's extremely hard but you will do it",A manic episode can trigger all sorts of imagined and delusional thoughts

"OK tell me if this sounds crazy but my daughter sees hears ans feels things in her room she's always saying she hears voices in her head ... I was cleaning her room tonight before she comes home tomorrow ans her dog was up there with me and she started wagging her tail ans cocking her head like someone was talking to her. .
Could it be possible my daughter isn't hearing voices in her head but it's the spirits or whatever she's hearing seeing and feeling ?",Get a medium in your home and they will tell you for sure,"Absolutely! It's entirely possible that your daughter is perceiving the presence of spirits or entities in her room. Children are often more sensitive to energies and can pick up on things that adults may not be aware of. The wagging tail and cocking of the head by her dog could indicate that there was indeed some form of communication happening. If you're open to exploring this further, you may consider reaching out to a spiritual counseling expert or a psychic medium who can help you understand and navigate these experiences. They can provide guidance on how to support your daughter and address any concerns you may have."
What is one piece of advice you would give someone who needs to improve their communication skills?,Listen or start with baby steps,Accept help
Just not happy with myself anymore always constantly feeling down and always arguing with my parents over stuff I can't control. There always mad at me never proud or anything like that.

"My partner of 5 years is struggling really bad with ptsd and depression, hes in his 40s now,  suffer physical abuse and mental abuse all his life, he wants a job want to get back on his feet, he gets a job and instead of talking to them he just doesn't go back, he lives with his parents ( where the abuse is ) we cannot live together at the moment due to my commitments. Hes hitting his addiction hard. Hes says he pushes people away and doesn't mean it, but the stuff he say hurts me so bad like he doesn't want to be with me. ( might move to london sleep in my car, or i might get bang up. I see both side, i suffer from anxiety and depression so i get it and try to support him hes not eatting or sleeping, he refused medication and refuse help and advice from me. I dont know whay else i can do, live with it or walk away, i dont want to walk away. And i never put a man down when hes feeling down.","Put you first
Make a good vs bad list see how that ways out 
Go with your Gut 
Be safe stay strong make a  safety plan","Advocate for self-care practices, like getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring joy. These small steps can have a positive impact on mental health."
"For once my life is going reasonably well , so why am I feeling as flat as a pancake, spending to much and eating to much ! Ug !","Well think you hit the nail on the head there with eating.....  Eating is a habit, and a lot of the time, an emotional habit. Our lives may be going well but as your post suggests, your life 'usually' doesn't go well...so even tho it's ok now, you're just waiting for the downturn to reappear, hence the (possible) anxious, comfort eating. And that's a perfectly normal response. 

If you were to analyse and recognise, that is what you are doing, and you understand it is NOT because you are hungry - then you can take steps to change that eating habit. 

Maybe put your shoes on and walk around the garden a few times, or to the end of the street and back, or start to jog...

It is well recognised that there is a link between mental health and physical well-being, and when we suffer mentally we don't exercise as much or take care of our bodies needs. By doing just 20 minutes of walking where you're not on your phone, or walking to the shops or pick the kids up - will increase your physical well-being and help you gain confidence in your decisions and life choices, and of course, just help you feel good in those moments when things are going well ❤️‍🩹","After long time stress situations your body need more food due the fact he has been over loaded and it is normal to fill flat ,  becaause you over worked mentally your body need regain energy"
"Hey, really need some support. At work they keep moving our room around (I work in childcare) and literally completely changing the whole layout of the room and it’s really upsetting me. It’s making me feel so on edge all the time and I’m scared to go into work Incase it’s changed again. I don’t know if it’s Because I was on holiday when the changes happened and I’m normally the one who does the changes that management want to make so it doesn’t effect me as much because I’ve done it but since coming back I just want to leave because I can’t cope with the changes. I’ve never ever felt like this before but it’s actually making me feel sick that I don’t know where anything belongs anymore! Can anyone give any support on this?","My advice is to communicate to your directors that the layout of the room and your ability to positively control the environment is foundational to your role.

I would communicate respectfully that it is stressful having the environment in a state of flux.  

Many people perform better in a static, rather than dynamic workplace, so don't be too hard on yourself.  I think this is a common experience among people.

I can empathize.  I've felt this way before.

Last bit of advice is concentrate on the kiddos and the things you can control.

Don't ruminate on the things you can't control and ultimately, remember that control is an illusion.","Agree that communication will be central, and I also found it interesting that you mentioned you hadn't felt like this before. Is there anything else going on for you at the moment? Or have you have a negative experience with change in the past?"

For 12years we walked a road of horror. Finally they diagnosed him after a cased was opened against him. He is taken away from me to be treatend at a mentally unit for 6months. The pic is what hes been diagnosed with. No one listened to me from the beginning to help my child, drs just didnt care. They didnt warry about how he was treated at schools, how he thought, how he cried at night, anxieties he had, i plead for help and all they did was lower or changed meds.

I kept going in circles, i would copy and paste this post and email it to the crisis team along with any thing else . if you feel at breaking point my love .

When ur at work at the hospital and ur kid shows up with officers cause of her mental health and needs to be admitted,I've seen that happen whilst I was still working.,"Also, (almost 30y ago) I confessed to a GP that my work stress, anxiety and depression were so bad at that point that I wished that I could go to sleep and never wake up.... He suggested a little break for assessment and rest..... where I was working at the time. I did laugh, explain the situation (I was being bullied by another staff member), and he concluded that my mental state was perhaps not as dire as he'd 1st thought since we were both amused by the irony and laughing like idiots."

"Do you see the girl rotating clockwise or counterclockwise? Answer in comments.

Answer below: 👇

If you see the girl rotating clockwise, then you are using the right hemisphere of your brain at the moment, and vice versa.

The right hemisphere represents people with artistic flair. The left hemisphere instead is linked to rationalism and generally organized mathematical thinking.

DONT suffer in silence! ❤️❤️,"Are you in a depression state, perhaps your doctor could help with medication? I was in this similar state due to chronic pain. My doctor told me it's more common than I know. I'm on meds that improve my mood and depressive lows. I added physical activity, exercise back into my daily routine. It really helps with mood, self esteem, and confidence. I still feel anxiety sometimes with public social interactions. I've been behind on outdoor housework. Indoors I'm able to stay on top of. But my chronic pain gets bad when I'm out doing physical stuff. Which adds to anxiety, fear of getting injuried. I had just recently injured my shoulder and reaggrevated my back injury. I'm trying to get outdoors more, that can help depression. I loved the outdoors before. It's hard trying to manage severe depression. Try to add some things back into your life.

"Hi all.
Does anyone have a fear of chemicals aswell as germs? I'm terrified of poisoning myself accidentally","These irantional fears can be the product of maladaptive coping mechanisms brought on by society's influence, or rather misinfluence.

Chemicals are of rational concern as are germs, however the problem arises when these concerns become irrational and seriously affects our daily lives.

Try to Remember~

1.) Our body is an amalgamation of chemicals.

2.) Human cells make up only 43% of the body's total cell count. The rest are microscopic colonists.  (according to the BBC)

3.) Moderate germ exposure boosts the immune system in most cases.  The history of vaccines shows this to be fundamentally true.

Lastly I'm not sure if rationalizing a (partially) irrational fear is helpful or hurtful.

If it is hurtful, I apologize for my ignorance and wish you the best.

If it us helpful, then I still apologize for my ignorance and wish you the best.",Are you struggling with OCD? If so I’d suggest you looking for ERP therapy…

"Got back in touch with my mum this year, my dad died last year and I decided to work on forgiveness for my mum but yesterday she gaslit me, it took me some hours to figure out what had happened and gain some regulation back because it was about something serious that happened in the past. 

It caught me by surprise, really upset me and I've had vivid dreams last night relating to it. It was an attack basically, ok so I've accepted I'm not going to get accountability from her and that our relationship is very limited because of her lies, I've figured that next time I speak to her I put some very strong boundaries in. 

I've read not to pull a narcissist up on lies as they will attack more but we can't let them get away with it surely, what would be the best way to approach it? Any ideas welcome..","You’ll never move forward with anything if you’re letting the past ruin today. You can’t change her, so either change your mindset or realize the relationship just won’t work. Go ahead and set the boundaries you want and see if she is willing to respect them. She sounds similar to my mom and I know that wouldn’t work with mine. I had to just tell her how I felt and forgave her for her actions towards me, but had to leave the relationship. Forgiveness isn’t based on the other individual, it’s solely based on you.","As rational.humans, we need to make sense of everything and we need to rationalise and put all our ducks in a row. And then we need to go back and revisit our own timelines and rectify and reorder the past thinking it will give us peace, or closure, or that it will help us make sense of our lives somehow...

Unfortunately life is not a well written book nor a well produced film. We have chapters badly written and scenes that don't play out as we would like. There is no rewrite or edit available unfortunately. 

The biggest peace for you will come with acceptance of this fact. You need to find your peace before you visit the past with anyone, otherwise you will always be unsettled. 

I tried to have a proper relationship as an adult with my estranged dad. But it didn't matter what I had achieved, he wouldn't acknowledge what I had done was anything special - built a multi 7 figure business, performed close up magic for the original members of Iron Maiden and probably the biggest actress on the planet, and now as a Hypnotherapist transforming mental health and physical well-being. 

Now at 77 he still has trouble engaging on a close personal level.

I realised a long time ago that it was his issue not mine. It hurt to cut him off and stop trying to reach him, or talk about the things I would like to share with a parent...

But I still visit him every month or two and the subjects we talk about are limited, and I'm ok with that, and I'm not sure he even notices. 

So find your peace - u can't change that person but you can change how a person affects you. 

Good luck 🥰"
"TW: Suicide.

Just to get it out of the way, so people don’t ask about it, yes, I see a therapist. Yes, I see a psychologist. Yes, I’m on medication.

*Now onto the meat of it all:
I’ve been going through a major depressive episode. About a week ago, it all came to a T, and I (28F) tried to hurt myself. I had a knife hidden in my dresser drawer and I was using it on myself. My husband (32M) walked in on me, and took the knife. As I said, it was a bad, bad day. I really wanted to be done with it all, so I was screaming at him to give it back.

Without my knowledge (I was focused on other things. I truly didn’t know), he took 9 audio recordings of me yelling for the knife and then sent them to his mother, who lives over 1600 miles away, and couldn’t help even if she tried. Somehow, those recordings ended up in the hands of my BIL who is a cop where they live.

He called the cops in our town, “anonymously” reporting a domestic dispute involving a deadly weapon. (I did end up in the behavioral health hospital after this, so please don’t comment that I need inpatient treatment. I got it and was released.) That all is how I found out about the recordings in the first place.

Since my return home, he’s been telling me he loves me, wants to connect, wants to help, etc., but tonight, I found out that he’s been exchanging text messages with everyone who was involved in the situation (we have an open-phone policy that goes both ways), and deleting the messages afterward. Fine. I wish he’d read my mind and known that I’d want us both to have some space from all of this, but he didn’t. Not his fault. So I asked that he not exchange messages with the people involved in this extremely traumatic experience for the time being, while I try to heal and let some of the anger I have toward the situation go (something I’m working on in therapy). He essentially told me no. What he actually said is that I can’t have control over who he talks to, but that translates to “no” in my book.

He completely betrayed my trust by recording me without my knowledge. He betrayed my trust by sending those recordings out. He betrayed my trust by hiding the recordings from me until circumstances forced my knowledge, and now he is betraying me by remaining in contact with the people involved.

On top of it all, since my return home, he’s deleting all of his text communications with everyone involved (we have an “open-phone policy - he can use my phone whenever, and I, his), claiming it’s a habit, or his phone is low on storage, or that he knows I’ll find something to be upset about in the messages, so he’s doing me a favor by getting rid of them.

And now he just keeps repeating that I sound paranoid, which he knows is a huge fear of mine, especially being prime-age for a psychotic/schizophrenic break.

I feel I have the right to be distrustful, but I also feel paranoid.

TLDR; my husband (32M) audio-recorded me (28F) trying to get a knife from him so that I could hurt myself, and sent those recordings out to his family, leading to the police being called. I get out of inpatient hospitalization, and he’s deleting all his text messages and being really touchy about his phone (we have an open-phone policy that goes both ways).","This sounds like a really tough experience for you. And it sounds like despite the possibility of paranoia, there's substantial evidence to show why you feel you can no longer trust this person.

Just wanted to check, did you have a question? Did you want some advice? Or did you just want to feel heard?","As someone who has recently been in a very similar situation (my son's Dad tried to take his own life 2 weeks ago) it sounds as though your husband was just trying to help. It sounds like he was recording you as it was easier than trying to explain to someone in words what was going on. During the last 2 weeks I have spent a lot of time on the phone and messaging the police, the hospital, and my ex's friends and family. I wouldn't especially want him to read the messages as I think it could upset him. However, they were just updates for everyone involved on the situation and I was doing it to try to help. I hope things improve for you soon. Xx"

"Joined the group because nobody is answering my calls and I feel like I'm dying a little. I disowned my sister today. Our brother died in 2010 so I now have no siblings left. To give you the gist I've been going through what I can only describe as a nuclear custody war over my 3 1/2 year old daughter since she turned 1. I had 50/50 custody after a little bit of difficulty reaching a mediation agreement. She came back about a year after we split and the ""reconciliation"" was an absolute dumpster fire. Doing the right thing, buckling down and working hard, being on a self improvement and spiritual journey and fighting for my daughter and the woman I used to love, it yielded no results. I was left feeling the way I did before when pur relationship started to fail. I felt ignored, used, unappreciated, and not really even treated like a person. She did get arrested twice for domestic battery against me. She's made up lies of violent threats to get an emergency custody order, so now i have to pay $60 an hour to see my daughter 3 hours a week and try to make every minute count, do all of the things I have to do as a father to make my daughter grow. I didn't see her for 9 months before we reunited. My daughter is hurting to have her dad around more. I hurt with her. I constantly feel helpless. My arm is broken because I was attacked with a baseball bat so I'm struggling to get back to work as a carpenter. I have to wear my cast for 2 more weeks. Financially struggling from being out of work. Today I got mad at my sister because I saw her doing business transactions with my ex on venmo and I felt like she was breaking bread with the enemy. I called her out. In a nutshell she said I don't know what real parenting is, called me a deadbeat and says I'm a drunk who never stepped up for his daughter. Made up some stories that I was always passing her off to my mom and dad so I could go out and get drunk. I've struggled with the bottle, but I've always been a good sober and present dad. I just can't believe my only living sister thinks so low of me and sides with my ex. It's a dagger in my heart. I had to disown her as my sister. I can't speak to her ever again. Having a very rough night guys.",May i suggest writing... getting your thoughts and feelings out on paper helps many people release.. you could write a book and change someone's life by sharing your experience and journey.. very theraputic,Awkward.

"Hi just joined this group as everything is just seeming a little bit much at the moment.  I’m not sure if it’s that I’m over thinking and my brain has just given up of if it’s that I’m actually dealing with a little too much. 
This may not be the right place to be posting. I think this may be more of emotional of trauma group thing. But here goes. I feel like I’m literally about to lose my shit.
I apologise this is going to be a long post! 
I’m a single, unemployed mum to an almost 18 (m) year old and a 12(f) year old. Have been a full time career for my youngest as she has a life limiting condition (cf) She was doing very well until recently when she decided that she would only take her very much needed medication when it suited her! Having constant battles with that. And I’m trying all kinds of bribery and punishments to get her to take it. Some days I’m on the verge of forcing it down her throat. Plus she’s hit puberty and periods so is sometimes just difficult for the sake of it. 
My oldest is non binary, (born male) and in a relationship with someone who is also non binary (born female) recently found out they are having sex. Was a bit of a shock as they are only ever together at my house. And they had a pregnancy scare a couple of weeks ago. They are using condoms but i am trying very much to get the ‘girl’ booked into clinic to get the pill. They live with grandparents who refuse to accept the non binary situation so are looking to me to take them on to the clinic. They are at my house EVERY  Saturday, without fail. Grandad is apparently blissfully ignorant to any goings on. 
They were planning on moving into my house together when they finished college, then dropped the bomb shell ON MY BIRTHDAY! That actually they are planning on moving away for
Uni to flat share with someone else! 

Bear with me it gets better. I dated a much younger man a few years ago, I was 35. He was 21. It got very dark and disturbing quite quickly. I ended it after 8 wks. Tried to stay friends, because I was friends with his mum and brothers. He burnt me with a lighter. Then pinned me in a kitchen screaming at me whilst my kids were there crying. That was me done completely! He then stalked me for 8 mths, watching me from his bedroom window. until he started dating one of my closest friends. We all live on the same street. She got engaged to him, had a baby with him and it’s a been a volatile relationship from the beginning. To my knowledge he’s never physically hurt her, but he emotionally abuses her all the time and tries to pin her into situations. Which I end up having to deal with. She’s often sat in my house crying and asking what she should do. Despite my advice she goes back to him. Until this week. She’s ended it and is (🤞) refusing to go back . I went through a lot of trauma getting out of my relationship with him. I almost left a house I love to be gone from him. She’s now in the same situation. 
I really want to support her taking this stand against him, but it’s only been a week and I’ve had 17 phone calls, 8 visits, more msgs than I can count and an add to a very toxic group msg group. I’m already so angry to the point that I want to take a bat to his head and my kids are back to being worried to leave the house if he’s in the street. 
She suffers with her mental health already and has a teen daughter that also does. 
So do I support her and just put boundaries in place so that she doesn’t affect my kids mental health (which as much as I love her, I think she’ll struggle to follow) or do I just cut off all ties?","Dr_good_tripz on instagram saved my life.

How do you move forward after a mental abusive relationship. And trust someone again. How do you build that confidence back . I feel like my life is slipping by because of my past . It’s hard to let go of what the abuse has done to you,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time after an abusive relationship. Healing from that kind of trauma takes time and effort, but please know that you're not alone in this journey. It's completely natural to feel like your past is holding you back, but remember that your past doesn't define your future.

Seeking professional help from a therapist who specializes in trauma can be incredibly beneficial. They can provide you with the guidance and tools to navigate through the emotions and challenges you're facing. Building back your confidence and trust will take time, but it's possible.

Surrounding yourself with supportive friends, family, or support groups can make a huge difference. And don't be afraid to take small steps toward rebuilding your self-esteem. Setting boundaries, practicing self-care, and focusing on your strengths can gradually help you regain a sense of control and stability.

Healing isn't linear. There will be ups and downs, but each step you take toward healing is a victory. Be patient with yourself and know that you deserve happiness and a healthy, fulfilling life moving forward.",Be  by yourself  you don't need a man find yourself

Hi I would like to have some kind  people to talk I'm a little lonely at the moment my boyfriend mostly works and I'm home alone pretty much and iv got mental health issues and struggling alot getting regular migraines constant mood swings and anxiety has gotten alot worse I don't like going out at all I'm house bound I worry going out because I get people giving me dirty looks or walking by laughing at me and my boyfriend won't defend me by telling them to stop so I started staying home as I feel the best solution I don't want to argue with mean people out there I put weight on and iv got very skinny eyebrows and I think that is why they are giving me the odd looks but it goes to show that people are sexist and care to much about how other women look if I was slim and I had thick eyebrows they wouldn't be looking at me strange I know exactly why there doing it but I don't agree with the reasons so many people are big it's nothing unusual or out of the ordinary but I think people have this perception that women should have a particular body shape and if your big or medium they will treat you differently and not respect you all these behaviours from people have escalated I don't think my mental health will improve if I don't stop getting bullied it's easy for people to want mentally ill people to get well but what if Ur bullied or have certain toxic people in Ur life,"Hi there.  I'm sorry you are feeling so low. Have you any friends at all you can invite round to your house seeing as your boyfriend works?  Are you able to start an activity hobby either at your house, a business making or selling or leave the house for a class I.e mexican cookery, art etc or is your mental health stopping that? 

Have you spoken to any doctors or under any care for mental health at all? Itnis good you are reaching out for support well done that's very brave 👏 I am sure others will write suggestions bit know uounare not alone and it is not only yiu who has difficulty leaving the house or believing others are looking at yiu when you do so.  

Have you got the motivation  within you to follow any exercise programme at home to make your metabolism higher and feelgood factor and proud of yourself for sticking to a plan? 

Just ideas but good luck x","Blessed Be to you and hugs. It isn't easy feeling alone and going through mental health issues where you also feel the whole world is judging you.  Know you are not alone and you are loved even though it doesn't feel like it.  Reaching out is a major step and you should take that into account as you move forward to feel better.  Everyone is different and unique in there own way and our situations are different and our society has the tendency to group us all together in all ways which is horrible.  But you will be okay and things will get better.  I talk to a therapist once a week and lately I've been going through an extremely depressed state to the point of almost having another nervous breakdown which I'm desperately trying to avoid.  And you know sometimes all it takes is even a caring stranger to talk to you to help you snap out of a mood or at least get you moving in the right direction to seek more help. I will also say this and it may sound harsh but this comes from personal experience....you are f ing beautiful just the way you are and don't EVER let this dysfunction society make you feel like how there making you feel!! Forget them they look at you funny hold your head up higher...I'm not saying be mean or judgemental of others I'm saying gather that self esteem...do things that make you happy and make you feel proud of yourself. Example me...I won't ever stop changing my hair...my color my hair style or cut no matter what anyone thinks and I won't stop jamming out to my music singing dancing even if it looks or sounds funny.  My job yeah it's just a job but at the same time it's my time to make things clean and disinfected and do good feel good about what I accomplished all the whole listening either to music or my audible stories (I'm a cleaner).  My point...you are you believe in yourself do things that you enjoy or love...learn to ignore whatever people may think...if you want to change something about yourself do that for you not anyone else. I myself consistently talks to myself in the mirror and I answer myself (weird but helpful) and there is nothing wrong with that it's one of my coping skills since I really don't have anyone else I can vent to none of us have an on call therapist.  My music, my audible stories, art, singing, poetry, nature all things I use for coping and yeah sometimes they don't always work but then I find something else to add to my list or I have a huge cry.  Anyway, you got this and I swear this society of ours is set on making us miserable on purpose... DON'T Let THEM! I 40 years old and have been going through crap my whole life and yes I am far from perfect and I have meltdowns and seriously messed up moments but you know what I keep coming back too...This too shall pass! You got this blessed be to you and big hugs!"
"So when you realize you're trauma bonded to a narcissist and addicted to the abuse cycles and you know the dangers of staying in the relationship and have left and lost so much over 18 months, and you leave, how do you get past that nagging urning to see them and speak to them again? How have you guys successfully maintained no contact without giving in? I think I probably need some therapy. But any other ideas are definitely welcomed. I'm so tired of this game and I want out. I moved out in July of this year, had been no contact for several months but recently started talking to him again. I went no contact again yesterday and I know for a fact I will start again by Thursday if I don't do something different.",You are in a co dependent relationship where you bounce off each other.

He has fallen through someone’s skylight because he was believed she was in there. He is running through woods etc trying to catch her up. 
He has now said he needs help he cannot go on like this. So I took him to hospital 7pm on Tues night. They put us in a side room  with a chair till 4pm Wednesday afternoon. They then put him in another side room with a chair till Wednesday night. Finally got a bed at 10pm in the main hospital, not a mental health hospital. He is still there. He is doing all he can not to kick off because his head is telling him to do loads of stuff he shouldn’t be in a normal hospital. He has no mental health people checking on him.

"My mental health is destroying me. 
I've always struggled I've been through alot of trauma (witnessed DV as a child to an alcoholic father,I became a single mum at 17 to a baby who has complex needs,ended up in a DV relationship myself abused in every way,lost permanent care of my daughter who has been adopted(she turns 13 this month),I've been in my current relationship for almost 10years,he's had his own issues and sadly relapsed in Sept 2021(no abuse) he has now been in recovery since Jan 2022,in June 2021 I lost my voice. Its now been diagnosed as a conversion disorder. Its been over a year of having no voice,I don't care about myself,don't take care of myself. Don't get me wrong I take care of everyone else (my dad who is in ill health,my mum who is on the verge of becoming homeless through no fault of her own,my son who's now 14 with his complex health needs a rare neurological condition,autism,adhd and severe learning difficulties I have to cover everything when it comes to his care which of course is my job). Since my voice went I just don't like being in the world,I feel like a burden,I can't even have a full conversation with anyone. I've had numerous counselling through the years. I have been having voice therapy since April 2022 and there's been no progress.  I now have to wait until Jan 2023 for my next appointment. I feel so pointless and yes of course I'm needed but I feel myself,as an individual is pointless.  I also have adenomyosis which puts me in agony probably around 14days a month. I can't go out anywhere to socialise because its exhausting,I'm feeling very lonely,isolated,forgotten whatever you wanna describe it as. 
I can't go to the shops unless I know exactly where things are,because asking for help becomes a complete chore and most people just blankly stare at me.

"Heya, I'm hoping to get some friendly advice.

My mum has always suffered with her mental health but especially recently I've noticed a deterioration. She's either very manic, or extremely sad. Me and my mum are EXTREMELY close and speak/ video call everyday without fail so I can easily pick up on any change she has.

She is saying things which are quite upsetting, worrying and completely out the blue but can't see that anything is wrong and we're all tiptoeing around her and being careful what we say so we don't trigger her. I've just been keeping in touch with her and being an ear so she can voice how she feels with no judgement. 

My mum has been through an awful lot, but is the strongest person in the world. I'm very aware two things can be true at the same time however. She's strong, extremely self aware but also very vulnerable. I'm trying to get her help without her knowing because she's very sensitive that people think she's crazy as she feels the things she's saying makes complete sense and that her ""eyes have finally opened."" I've tried to ring her doctors but they can only assess her if she agrees. 

Has anyone got any advice how I can approach her to get help, or if there are any services that can step in? I'm very worried where things can go if they get worst and just at my wits end with what to do next or how I can help her get back to the best version of herself. TIA x","Sorry can't really add a lot here but one thing that speeds up deterioration, especially in over 60s, is dehydration.

"Hi people
I’m not sure if anyone in this group is familiar with the “support” services CAMHS…
I’m under 18 so not much mental health support is available. But I practically screamed for help multiple times on a phone call appointment and was just so unheard and disregarded.
I’m struggling a lot with so many issues and have family history of bipolar and bpd in both sides, and aware these kinds of things are hereditary…
Are there any support services in The UK close to Wiltshire that will actually listen and help… I’ve given up with Camhs and and seriously not surprised that the teenage suicide rate is so high when that’s the only support we’re offered!

"⚠️Trigger Warning⚠️ Binge Eating, Numbers, Weight Gain⛔️

Hello I am reaching out for some support. I am struggling with anxiety and depression due to this recent weight gain and it has slowly taken over me. I am currently in a slump because I have gained over 35 pounds in two years. I used to be 135 and so happy. I am somewhere around 175 now..I started gaining some weight because I was traveling frequently. It was only a few pounds but I noticed and I started obsessing. So I tried losing weight yeah I lost some but it was temporary something would come up and I would fall behind. Whether it was a big social event that involved eating “unhealthy” food or just waking up late. (I hated waking up late because I would always go to the gym early and when I woke up late I usually had no motivation to go the gym) Any small thing would set me back. Then came the binge eating.. worst thing ever. I figured if I couldn’t start that day let me start on monday or a specific date. Till that date came I ate and ate and ate. I would eat until I was literally sick. I would feel so guilty and then I would start the restriction. The day would come when I was supposed to start, if I slipped up one tiny thing in my plan and it ruined me. In the process of me hyper fixating on my weight I let myself stray away from my studies. I have an addiction -procrastination-. My grades have slipped because of this. My high standards that I used to follow I have not been able to follow them. And I hate myself for it but I am reaching out now I need help and support. I actually did good for about a month in the summer and lost 7 pounds and I felt great but then I started school again. I didn’t control myself I would get hungry after school and my binge habits came back. Then the comments about my body from my peers didn’t help either. I am at the point I just want to give up. I hate eating around people so I end up eating large portions of food at night. I just need some guidance and support. Just a side note, I have contacted nutritionist and I followed plans but I have always seem to fall back and I have basically come to a point where I have given up. This is my last try but I am really hoping to get back on my feet again. I also am not up to trying any supplements/medication. I want to lose weight naturally! Thank you if you read all of this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",Come join my live for Q&A hopefully I can help with some awareness I am a mental heath nurse and currently on section in hospital,Dm
"Trigger warning suicide Ideation. 

For as Long as I can remember I've considered/thought about suicide. It hasn't been a consistent feeling and it has varied in intensity. But the feeling has been there for the majority of my life. I think the only time I didn't have the thoughts/feelings is when I was very, very young. I think it would be safe to say the only reason I haven't tried is because I don't have the courage. (for lack of a better term) I guess that's a blessing. Of course there is a very small part of me that wants to keep living, but I can feel that part of me getting smaller and smaller, but the good news is that I don't think i'll ever have the courage to go through with it. And I know there are people in my life that want me to stick around so that's another thing that kind of keeps me going.  But the point to this long text is this.  How many of us committed suicide a long time ago but our bodies, our consciousness just didn't get the message. I suspect there is a lot of us. In other word's even though we are alive,  we haven't been living for a very long time. Just existing, going through the motions of life but not feeling anything. Just getting through one day after the next. I suppose this is better than actually being dead, because at least this way there is still a little bit of hope, a chance. That maybe one day with a lot of effort and some luck things can be better and we can start really living for possibly the first time in life. 

It's at this point I feel like I should try to offer some hope after what is a pretty dark and depressing post. All I can say is don't give up, hang in there. There are people who need you and love you. You probably have a bigger impact on people's lives around you than you realize. And we might be in pain now, and life might really suck for a big verity of reasons there's always a chance that things can change. If we ended it now we would be missing out on what might have been.  I know this is all Cliche, but it's true.  It's the hope that I hold on to and that keeps me going. I hope that it will keep you going too.",Come join my live for Q&A hopefully I can help with some awareness I am a mental heath nurse and currently on section in hospital,Dm

"I'm trying to support my friend who is going through a relapse from anorexia. She is on low income and wants to get help through NHS or non-private-priced services.

Please advise, many thanks.",Sorry to hear she was turned down by an eating disorder clinic. I'm assuming she must have made contact with her GP.

"Hello everyone. Before starting I want to mention a trigger warning. I tried my best of what I knew how to censor sensitive words and so on but I'm not sure I did well. I'm not somebody who posts something or even opens up to anyone but I'm in the really bad mental situation and I don't have anyone at all to talk to. I had my now ex best friend that our friendship ended because of terrible argument and now looking back after some time I can see that that friendship was only beneficial to her and quite toxic but I stayed because I didn't want to be alone and wanted to have someone to talk to because even though I am medically diagnosed with anxiety disorder and OCD my parents don't take it seriously and even get mad at me when I go silent because my mental health is getting worse. I'll put a couple of messages after this post what my mom wrote to me today. My parents were never emotionally available and when I was bullied or had any problems they just told me to just not pay any attention to those people or that they have worse problems and my problems doesn't count. So I shut down and all they know about me is my created character that I act in front of them because it's easier to do that than to exhaust yourself trying to explain to them my mental illness and how I'm feeling and risk being called a liar or manipulator or being yelled at. 3 years ago I myself found and went to the psychiatrist to get help because I was in a super bad place where I even considered su1c1d3 and was s3lf h4rm1ng. No one knew about it and noone cared I just knew that if I won't do something I won't be on this earth for much longer. Now after 3 years I'm doing much better and I'm on medication and seeing professional even though there's still bad periods where my mental health declines drastically but then after some time I resurface and continue trying to get better. Last year I had a huge downfall because my uncle who was more like my dad emotionally then my actual dad that I'm honestly afraid of to talk to or ask anything because I don't know when or what will set him if and he'll scream at me or I don't put past him anything else. So last year my uncle I mentioned committed su1c1d3 that literally took the ground from under my feet because even though him passing was hurtful enough that reminded me of where I could have been then 2 years ago exactly in his place if I didn't get help. It still hurts till today but at least I can remember him and think about him without those terrible pictures and voices and memories in my head. At the moment I'm not in a terrible place but in a quite bad place mentally and have a few problems like having to take my guinea pig to the vet because she has a weird lump and my parents don't care at all and I'm struggling to convince them to help me to pay for her visit. I love animals more than anything. In my life they're the only thing that truly loves and cares about me.  And just beyond that it's just a period of time when I again got worse and my mental health declined and I need to wait and work it through but it's just I'm completely alone, with noone to talk to, with noone who cares or understands me and even though me being introvert now screams at me what am I doing posting here but it seems like the only chance to get heard by someone because I'm struggling and I don't want to give in into my dark thoughts again. If anyone would be able to read this and hear me and help me that would mean more than I could ever express in my life. 😔😢

This image is the text my mom sent me today not wanting to talk so to let my father rest and not disturb him. From my point of view I spent my days in constant fear waiting for them to come back from work as to finish and get done everything so I won't get screamed at but I guess I'm still not doing enough. I usually cannot fall asleep because of my anxiety and stay up late on my phone because then I feel safe, they're sleeping and I won't get screamed at or anything else and I can just have my time either way I cannot sleep and just lay there looking at the ceiling.",You are doing well by recognising ‘the signs’ before they happen - this is a huge and positive step to learning to live with and manage depression. Be proud that you have made this start for your self.,"Does your country have a disability income for people who are disabled and if so you might check to see if mental health is one that qualifies or if your back pain is enough to qualify. Because if you can get disability income plus some welfare help you can move out of your parents house. They seem to be toxic to you right now. Which I understand, my mom was toxic to me and I spent my senior year of high school in an institution until I graduated, then I moved in with my grandparents in another state to get ready for college. My baby sister followed soon after but moved in with our dad and step family. You might look up a book titled TOXIC PARENTS by Dr. Susan Forward with Craig Buck. It may be helpful to you."

"Hi! I recently joined this group as I have been facing utter depression from past few months! I've always feared of losing people in my life either my family or friends. I was never this guy with such a small circle, but somehow converted into an introvert guy having just 4 to 5 friends. The fact is, i just did almost everything for my friends as I know that what you give is what you recieve. From the past years, I've found it so hard to cope from my problems and get out of the dark phase alone, i needed help from the only friends that were left in my life. I never found any single one of them in my hard times and always blamed myself (still do) that if you are alone in your downtime, you did not give them enough support. I've damn tried everything even forgot myself in the process of giving them all i could offer but still struggling in my downtime on my own.. I feel like i want to scream out loud to them that i need you guys the way you needed me, i need you now please!!! I'm a 24yrs old guy and sometimes i just cry like a baby in shower or in my bed and can't help myself! I feel ashamed of crying as guys normally don't cry but trust me i can't help myself! Writing this all down here just to express as i got nowhere to go or to talk!",Always look after yourself first. If you help someone else make sure they help you. Friendship is a two way street.

#trigger warning 
I don’t know where to start…..
Nov 21 I decided I had had enough of my Narcissistic  husband of 18 years….. stupidly I took him back ( he had started ta￼liking to another woman I thought nothing of it) then February 22 I was strong enough to tell him I want out I couldn’t take no more of him and his ways, our kids were seeing the fights, arguments and the way he treated me, he would be all nice to me saying let’s go to mc D for a hot choc get me in the car away from the house and start screaming at me I would come home emotional and go straight to bed…. 
February he started looking for another house and strangely enough started talking again to the same woman he did in the Nov ( he hadn’t stopped things now I noticed I now see why he did it like turn his WhatsApp status off become distant and treating me worse) this went on like this till April when he moved out. Since then he’s turned my mother and brothers against me, my mother knowing he raped me, hearing him when she called me shouting at me to get in my bedroom ( I locked from the day he forced himself on me ) she’s even met his new woman ( from the Nov) saying how nice she is, when I confronted her about everything her words were “ what do you expect me to do about it” she’s never been supportive or there for me so shouldn’t have expected anything different my brothers are also the same…. He’s turned my older kids against me ( not even his kids) and now this weekend 2 of our 3 kids are moving in with him, meaning I’m losing my kids ( I’ve been there for them since day one no support from him) and now he’s the best thing because he’s buying them. I’m so down at the min an emotional wreck don’t want to be in this house , I do work but only part time I’m just trying to find a good support net work for when I’m feeling low I can chat to someone I do have a very supportive boyfriend but I don’t any to scare him away 😞",I agree with the lady above you don’t deserve what he is putting you through see your doctor tell them everything they point you to resources if you need to talk you can call the crisis line I will be praying for you,Don’t stop talking to your family and kids. Eventually he will reveal himself to everyone in one way or another. Be there to support your kids when it happens.

I just want to feel and be happy again.",Yes get support from your doctor. Get sick notes for the benefits agency. You need a break. Take a couple weeks off with your doctors permission. Meds take a couple of weeks to work. But your doctor will know what's best. Ask him for time off work. Maybe you will get a better job.,Don’t you get vacation days? I definitely would take off I was in a mental hospital and I called work and I quit I had no money about a month ago I applied for disability and to my surprise the check came the week ii got out talk about miracles from God don’t make any serious decisions one thing you can do maybe apply for disability it takes a while now to get disability if you would get it you could work part time

I'm a natural born worrier and I've recently started a new job and have feelings of anxiousness and worry which are becoming out of control, I just cannot seem to relax and am constantly overthinking and anticipating things which haven't even happened yet, it's like a vicious cycle which I cannot seem to switch off from ☹️ Does anyone have any tips or advice for next steps?!?

"Me and my partner broke up (on valentines btw) I’ve been struggling a lot recently a lot with my mental health things at home/family/work and my health and it’s all too much for me right now. My partner got up and left before the new year cos we were fighting and arguing a lot and it was too much for him more so. So we took a break, we came back and talked things out and he moved back in, but the last couple of weeks more so last week I’ve been really struggling having major breakdowns feeling sick and I did get moody and take things out on him but I was so heightened with everything and I know I shouldn’t because tbh that’s what’s drove him away and I need help I’ve had the doctors with mental health nurse and starting that for myself: I knew something was up all day my mum phoned and told me he’s packed all his stuff and gone to his aunties I haven’t heard from him only from the message he text my mum, I’m so hurt I’m so angry. I knew something was up by the texts etc and he’s done this before just went to his aunties and stayed without speaking to me like a man and grow up and tell me the truth instead he abandoned me and we had a lot of moments last week but not mainly because of us but because of me and how much I’m struggling with my mental health and clearly he can’t cope with my mental health and all last week he kept saying I’ll never leave you like I did again I’ll always be here through thick and thin etc and he’s got up and left took all his stuff and left. my mum phoned him to find out what’s going on and basically alot of it he’s not telling the truth and threw me under the bus to the point he’s making it about him and I’ve ruined him (he didn’t say but implying it). I haven’t told my parents how much I’m struggling yet and was going to in my own time and he’s blabbed and said it to them and I’m quite annoyed at 

Been thinking of everything and all the stress tbh we have and he has put me through. With the fact he got up and left the first and now he waited for me to leave yesterday and pack up and leave he only just messaged at about 10:15ish where I have been on edge since all day on valentines I’ve realised he’s been a mind f**k telling me how much he loves me, how much he won’t abandon me he’s lied to my parents about things and pretty much threw me under the bus and knowing I’m struggling and panicking and freaking out when he was away having the time of his life having a birthday meal leaving me having panic attacks, I don’t think he is the right guy for me knowing that if we got back together I’m going to be constantly in my head worrying what if my moods or mental health is too much and he leaves again and if we had a future if it got too much when we got a house or children and got up and left 

Please let me know thanks","You have the answers you are seeking, in this post. I am not berating your partner but he left when things got hard, he may leave again but in the same breath he came back, but the trust is broken. You are worth more than that but you should listen to your inner guru, you know the one that wrote the post?

Sigh so the pain and inflammation has spread to from my shoulders to my elbows and thumbs plus  from my hips and knees to my ankle and feet. Fed up my symptoms are spreading to new joints and muscles. I already had it in my shoulders back hips and right knee if this carries rather than just ending up needing wheelchair which I was felt was gonna need in a few years instead it looks like I'm gonna end up bed bound and needing everything done for me as within a few years. How am I supposed to accept this I hope the doctors can find a way to stop it getting that far. I still don't know what symptoms are being caused by which disorder so don't know if they can be treated.,Surely someone can make a diagnosis?,"Fibromyalgia sounds possible I’d say

I'm really struggling to see the point of life if all I'm going to have is suffering and ruined dreams with no one trying to help me!","I'm under several doctors as is but they don't understand the cause of my symptoms and my test result make no sense to them so they try to spend as little time as possible on my problems. They sometimes lie to get rid of me as they don't want to spend time on a time consuming patient with complex problems.

the neurologist I saw was no help he lied and fudged results and insulted me and I tried to see a different neurologist but couldn't as the only one available was the assistant of the one I was already seeing and he was not gonna take me on an risk offending his boss, the siezure specalist I was seeing who had some success in helping me moved away and I haven't been able to find another seizure specalist. I tried getting referred to pain specalist and am still waiting. I'm on waiting list to have my vision problems investigated again. What's pushed me over the edge is for years they been telling me my blood tests are normal but when I asked about my latest blood results at my GP clinic the receptionist let slip apart from my blood sugar levels and cholesterol all my other blood markers are out of range as is normal for me. I have never been told by any of my doctors that it's normal for my red blood markers to be too low, my white blood markers to be too high, to show markers showing inflammation and markers for liver and kidney function also out of the normal range but this is apparantly normal for me.

She has disappeared with our children and all our valuables. Its a long story but in trying to find my family and doing a lot of research on the matter, I discovered there is just not enough awareness out there. It can be tricky dealing with someone who suffers from mental illness but i also discovered how much it has affected my own mental illness. I always thought I was strong enough to deal with anything but this has shown me how vulnerable we all are when things change so rapidly. You don't have to be born with it. Sometimes life throws you a curve ball that can change everything in an instant, like what happened to me. needless to say, in trying to find my family and get my wife the help she needs, I discovered so much and now I have become an advocate for mental illness. I have created a website( still under construction) for people who are suffering in some shape form or fashion, or know someone who is. it also explains my story but I also have advice articles that may be able to help those in need and to help increase awareness. A lot of these things are things that have helped me on my journey so I want to spread the knowledge. I am not a doctor or professional in that field but I have learned a lot. I believe what I am experiencing is a blessing in disguise from God to do my part to help others or to at least share what I have learned. I have learned a lot about myself being alone and my home being so quiet. There is such a lack of understanding, empathy, and care when it comes to mental health. I know this because I was one of those who just didn't understand so I made a lot of mistakes when it came down to understanding exactly what my wife needed from me and even though she did not communicate with me on the things she needed me to understand, I should've done the research so I could know what to do. Maybe too little too late now. So I want to help others before it's too late for them.",Good afternoon everyone and welcome
"Simply wait for my grandparents to be asleep for sure before I definitely ring a helpline.  Im not okay and i am faking that I am,  its hard unable to talk about anything.",Here for u,Good luck
"Even tho I’m a bit better I still feel low 

It’s this weird funk I dunno how to get rid of 

Oh well just stating I guess so some part of this funk can go away cuz I was tending to keep to myself but I was going insane so I guess I type it here",I'm not sure what you mean. I am lethargic and need a lot of motivation to get going. I'm quite happy to amuse myself and do little else. I eat and sleep a lot. I would love to be more active. Do little things that cheer you up. Smile at people even though you are sad inside. Once you start good habits you will reap rewards,Good luck
"I left an abusive relationship. 
My mom begged me before she died to leave and it actually caused fights between us. 

After she passed away, the mental and emotional abuse got worse.. 

Until a couple months ago when he hit me. I started thinking about leaving. So I finally did. I'm set to go to a shelter on Monday and currently was able to get the motel for a night before he drained the accounts.

I wish you were here to see me mom. But I hear you. We might be hungry we might have to sleep in a car for a couple nights but... 

Your grandbabies will see me happy again and be loved the way I deserve","Well done hun, you got this 💛 x",Good luck for the future. Xxx
"I’m so sorry this is going to be a long post, I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2012 but I’ve been gradually getting worse in how I’m feeling and I feel like I have more then just anxiety and depression, I have written down everything I feel, I know none of you are doctors but I was just wondering what your thoughts are? do you think all this is just anxiety and depression or could it be something else along side that, I’m just sick of feeling the way I’m feeling, I just want to feel normal 😭 thanks x 

I feel over whelmed when there’s so much going on In a room for example kids playing, tv on, tap running, someone’s phone also playing loud etc 

Social anxiety, I don’t like being around people, small talk or being out in public it makes me so tired 

I believe everyone judges me on how I look and instantly doesn’t like me 

I have to do certain things other wise I fear something bad will happen to my children for example I have to make sure all the washing is the right way and not inside out when it goes in the machine, I have to fill my water glass up a certain way 

If I’m going anywhere I plan and re plan my journey so I know I will never be late as being late makes me anxious 

I don’t like change, I have to keep to routine other wise I feel like everything is falling apart and I get really over whelmed 

My mood can go from 0-100 in the matter of seconds, I snap really easily 

I worry constantly, I literally worry about worrying 

I struggle sleeping at night but then struggle staying awake in the day, I’m always so tired 

I have difficulty concentrating the room has to be silent and only me in to be able to watch tv other wise I’m easily distracted 

If I do end up watching something I’m up and down because I remember I need to do certain task and I can’t relax until it’s done 

I make little tasks/chores seem like massive tasks in my head then I get really over Whelmed and stressed and start hand fidgeting or rubbing my eyes and then get angry 

I don’t like people in my home like workmen or if I know the gardeners due my anxiety is up and I can’t relax until I know that person has gone 

I make list after list for bills or planning a holiday, if I don’t make lists i dont feel organised or know what I’m doing 

I don’t make friends or have any friends I like being on my own, in my own home, I don’t really go out as I hate being out in public 

I also hate making eye contact, making eye contact makes me feel really uncomfortable 

I can’t go to bed if I know there’s stuff that needs doing, so all pots need to be done etc because I can’t wake up to mess 

If I make plans and then the plans have to change suddenly, I struggle to adjust",Are you getting treatment for anxiety and depression? Seems like your giving yourself too much work to do. How are your finances? Do you have o.c.d.?,Good luck with everything. Keep in touch

"When im home alone struggling mentally,  emotionally,  yet dont know when my younger brother will be home. So im terrified to ring a helpline.   

Sounds like excuses but its difficult to understand how i feel. How do i expect family to understand and help when I dont know where to start with my life.","i think you should call them, they dont pass it on to your doctors, and i dont think family could probably stay home 24 hrs. your gp should have linked you to a therapist","Had a day out somewhere never been before West Acher Gardens, nursery coffee shop, very good for you."
,I have  had a lovely  day today first of me meeting with  some  of my family  members  x,"Had a fairly busy day, returning articles that don’t work , collecting stuff from Ikea and ironing , my least favorite job.

"I'm still feeling rubbish. Anxiety is all over the place. My ptsd is bad, keep remembering my brother. 

I'm totally knackered as I can't sleep plus I'm not eating apart from 3 slices of toast a day. I'm a big girl and diabetic so I know its not doing me any good.

My cats have made a mess and I'm trying to ignore it until tomorrow. It's only cat litter on the carpet.

"Hey guys n gals. Ive just joined up with the group. Thought I’d introduce myself, im from Brighton, UK, have suffered with depression for many years, but recently diagnosed with Bipolar and PTSD amongst others..
Just wanted to say hi really and offer an ear if anyone needs to talk. Hope you all have a great day 👍🏽",welcome to the page bud,Has any one try this
"I'm new here and I am really struggling. I lost my father about 3 months ago. My mother is now blaming me for her loneliness.  She thinks I don't care about her. I live about 800 miles away. I have asked her several times if she wanted me to come back home to stay and she always says no. Now she says that I left her. She is mean and hateful to me when I call to check on her which is every day. I am her only child and a huge disappointment to her. I am in my 50's and am just trying to live my life the best that I can. I have always been respectful of my parents and tried to be the perfect daughter. I am really feeling lost and depressed and don't know what to do. At this point, moving back would just make me her live in punching bag but if I don't move back I am a bad and in her words crazy person. I'm wrong no matter how hard I try.....","I had a similar time with my dad. For 15 yrs after my mum died he was looked after by myself and my sisters. We cooked and had him to our houses even those he was more often than not derogatory and miserable.  We put it down to grief but after 15 yrs he still wasn't much better.  Everything we did was wrong. He blamed us for his loneliness and constantly let us know how badly we let him down playing one sister against another.  2 yrs ago I started suffering with more severe depression partly down to him and his needs. I had tried to be a good daughter and had been made to feel useless but it suddenly dawned on me. Whatever I do, he will never be happy or grateful for, his attitude was he can be Whatever he wants and we owe him for being born and that he kept us alive whilst dependent.  I realised that if I was going to get grief for being as good as I could be to please him, it would be no different if I didn't do those things. They like power to hold you with emotional blackmail.  Give yourself a pat on the back for trying as long as you have but step back. She is selfish and needs to realise you are worth so much more. I went no contact a couple of years ago and it's the best thing I ever did. You are far away enough to put boundaries in place.  If I were you I would limit the phone calls to minimal and tell her it will stay that way until she changes and stick to it. If she gets worse then no phone calls at all. People like that are never happy until they make everyone as miserable as they are. Respect is something everyone is entitled to including you. Remember to put yourself first for a change. (Sorry long post but I can see where you are heading and she doesn't deserve it from what you have said.) When she treats you like a human being then you can revise your contact. Don't feel guilty for not accepting abuse. X good luck",Has your mother seen a doctor recently? It sounds like she might be suffering from dementia. I'm no doctor but have experienced this with my grandmother.
What do you say is a reason people struggle to be authentic and less self-judgmental?,"People fear rejection and want to be accepted, and therefore they change according to what is seen as acceptable in society.","HATERS, and being volerable is a great way to get attacked"
Merry Christmas 🎄 to you all and happy new year,Same to u,Have a blessing new year

As for listening I'm good at that and a coach good at giving advice :)  7, hrs with no comments well here's one.

"Hello group. I have a delicate situation right now. I have a very sweet young man for a friend who has schizophrenia and he is homeless.  He has pushed me away. He has been acting more and more afraid, talking of super powers, things that are hard to understand and just generally not making much sense, This is totally out of charector for him. He has gone off of his medication, which is probably why he is having a psychotic breakdown., and has went missing after saying he'd have to distance himself from his loved ones. This is the first person I've ever really gotten to know really well that has this mental illness. I worry for his safety and wellbeing. I know that he's not going to be located very easily, at least for now. Can someone please help me to understand what he is going through? How could I help him? What can I expect, if anything, going forward?","There’s nothing you can really do except be kind to yourself. 

I’ve been there. My mother was bi polar. When she went into a manic episode, there was no force under the sun that could help her. 

I’m sorry. This is just a truth of the illness. I always stuck around and it battered me my entire life, the impotence of a son wanting to help but unable to do anything except watch the descent into madness. 

The illness is altering his perception of reality. His truth. The reality is so foreign to you that you cannot possible grasp it to even emphasize. As I say in my podcast about depression, it’s like if I told you the sky was an orange pastel, roses smelled like horses, filet mignon tasted like halibut and a baby’s cry sounded like Mozart. If this was my reality, how how could you understand? 

He needs to be on his meds and get professional treatment, probably hospitalization to get the meds stabilized. 

I’m sorry.","Have him sectioned as soon as possible.
From someone with schizophrenia. It's for his own saftey, irrespective of what or how he feels about you after. Have him medically looked at."
Hi everyone I’ve been on antidepressants for 20yrs they stop working they give you something else .I’ve been through them all .My pychtrist put me on cold turkey coming off of mitazipine still on Prozac diazepam 3 times aday and zoplcone for sleep .Have thoughts in my head constantly what’s being done nothing .Find it hard to live everyday .Want my life back and to be happy .Hugs to everyone that needs them today .The system is a joke and this is peoples life’s 😞,I am so sorry that you are going through this! I understand...I could write a book listing all the meds I have been on and they play around with them like we are eating candy. And lord knows I agree about the mental health system no matter where you live...it sucks! Hang in there girl...you have been through worse and survived and you'll damn well be a warrior through this!,Have never taken a drug.  Go without em

"Hi My name is Crystal I live in Washington I suffer from anxiety, depression ,ADHD and PTSD and I feel like I can't do it alone anymore I've lost a lot of friends and family because they do not understand or in their words I'm just crazy and why can't I be normal my therapist said it would be really good if I found a support group and there are a lot of people like me I'm very new at this but I feel I need support or I'm just going to keep drowning and that one day I will lose my battle",Yes my grandfather was a pastor and my father is a pastor,Have you checked with your local hospital sometimes they offer support groups find out if there is a outpatient program near you i suffer From depression PTSD anxiety bipolar 2 I get some some support from friends my therapist psychiatrist I am getting more support right now from from the outpatient program it’s a program that i  go to three days a week three hours a week there are people there with all kind of different kinds of mental health issues you’re not crazy I don’t talk to my family about my family I think it’s French to them
I wish I wasn’t here anymore,"Keep being strong. I get it and I feel it too. 
You’re a whole lot stronger than you probably give yourself credit for.. so many people love you I’m sure.. just take little steps each day and it will get better xx",Have you considered counselling?
"So, I kinda had an epiphany today. I realized that I am, in fact, *not* a sociopathy, because the thought that I might've been had me feeling anxious, worrying that I would've been harmful to other people. Also feeling remorseful about the people that I *have* hurt in the past, sometimes even heartbroken. However, I still intend to mention that concern to my therapist.

However, more importantly, I discovered that my ego actually has been rampaging out if control for quite a number of years. Which may very likely be the reason why I've inadvertently hurt those people in the past, but may also be the underlying reason for many of the things I've wanted in life, that I now realize may actually be harmful to either myself or others.

Since that discovery, I've been doing some reflection and meditation, trying to ""tame and retrain"" my ego. Not only getting it under control, but also trying to harness it the way it should be. The way a healthy and properly developed ego should be.

But I think that in the attempt, I've lost my identity, or maybe just need to take some time, and the guidance of therapy, to discover who I am now.

Update: I know what happened now. I purged all the bad shit, but didn't think to replace it with good shit, so I was basically empty. An easy fix for a ""shadow worker"" 😆",As long as you are not hurting people surely you can be yourself. If you are hurting other people is there a medication you can take to calm yourself down?,Have you ever tried making amends to the people you have hurt it refreshes the soul
I dont know how much I can take with not wanting to live am only living for my daughter I haven't had a bath or washed my hair in over 1 month or cleaned my floors,"Then you certainly have a purpose in life,(your daughter, and many more people)do need you in there lives.  If your at rock bottom now the only way you can go now is up..yes it's hard,1 day,hour,minute at a time...keep fighting.

If animals  ment alot to u would u do anything  to have one example  I want another dog but my partner  and landlord  won't let  me been so cut up losing my girl 7 months  ago  she was the only thing kept me going my family  nasty  fill so lonely  I thinking  making  myself  homeless  just so I can have a dog again or am I just mad I don't no anymore  but carnt stop crying,"I've gone for pet friendly accomodation over the last 20 years, it's better company. Apply for it","Have you moved since you lost your girl? Or still in the same house/flat? If still in the same place why does the landlord now have an issue? And is it just with dogs or all pets? 

I lost my dog a Year and half ago and was devastated so I completely understand your pain. I Couldn’t face getting another dog straight away and my daughter wanted a cat. So we got 2. 
I wouldn’t risk myself homeless for a pet, could you look into moving somewhere that allows animals before you get another 1? Or as someone else said, if it’s registered as a support animal the landlord has to allow it. 
I would consider binning the partner though. I wouldn’t be with anyone that wouldn’t accept that animals are going to be a constant part of my life"
I need advice i worried i got boarderline personality disorder because i lose who i am sometimes like i a different person next i feel like i not got care in world from what i learned i had so traumatized things happen to me like i once lost someone important to me we i did not cry i just stand there doing nothing,How did you come to this diagnosis?,Have you tried any kind of healing therapies & shadow work to get to the root of these challenges you're facing?

"April last year I decided to no longer take sertraline as it wasn't working. I got prescribed venlafaxine, but that gave me side effects. Because of the side effects that venlafaxine gave me I decided to no longer take medication. I'm still currently not taking any medication and won't be because I have developed a fear of medication. I am more stressed and worry more. I am angry easily and aggressive. I have developed a lot of fears. I have a fear of socialising and going to the doctors for fear of picking up a bug. My behaviour has gotten worse to the point where the people that I live with can no longer cope with me. Help has been attempted to be got for me, but either I've been referred or put on waiting lists.

"My mom's fiancé went into cardiac arrest yesterday morning, they were resuscitating him for about an hour, my 16 yo brother for 15 minutes and when EMTs arrived they continuted for another 45 minutes.. they managed to bring him back, but he was down for so long his brain is swollen, he's in coma and they don't give him any chances .. the swelling is getting worse, they already talked about organs donation.. I'm so scared for my mom, worried sick.. this is the third man in her life that will probably die.. first my dad, then her boyfriend about 5 years ago and now this.. they were supposed to get married on February 24th..
I don't live with them, I moved away about 6 months ago.. she's gonna be alone with my 2 younger brothers, I think she won't be able to make it.. mentally or financially, she makes just enough to pay her bills, not counting groceries.. 
She's so sad, she's sobbing and I can't do anything.. I'm drained, I also cannot stop crying, my mom is so unlucky .. I cannot even talk about it out loud, I just needed to vent .. there are many little details that are making it even worse.. I feel that I lost control.. I just want her pain to stop and for her to be happy for once",I relate but in different ways and connections.  Very bad for y'all.  Wishing u strength,"He didn't make it, he died this morning"
Hello everyone. I’ve got a lot going on in my head at the moment and would love someone to talk it all out with,Hi,Hear to listen xx
"Hi, I'm from jakarta indonesia (south asia), so I just found out that I have anxiety desorder and depression last month (because I go to psychiatrist). First of all I don't want to tell anyone about this except my friend, but then I need money to go to a doctor right? So I tell my dad about this (I'm still 18 by the way, and right now I'm still in college). But then, after I told my dad about this. my dad reaction was, you need pray and talk to God. It's so hard and tired, lived with people who doesn't have open minded about mental health. 

Now I have to take medicine for my anxiety and depression. 

My dad approves me to go to psychiatrist, but he keeps saying you need to pray more. But I already done all of that :)). Then when I ask him truly, he said honestly I don't like you to go to psychiatrist and take meds, you just need put your faith in God, and everything will goes away, yeah I know all of that. Please I just need support to go through this :""""). 

I'm just want to share about my feelings and my mental health story. 

Thanks (sorry if I'm bad at english)","Sweetheart, U don’t need drugs.  God is great too, U don’t need religion.  I used to be 18, and was alone-, frightened & asking Too many questions.  Open your mind, help others who R in a bad situation.  It’ll make U feel good.

I’m trying to make changes for the better and just now it two forward the ten back . Just really wanted to say hello",Hello Robert.  Can I ask why you dont trust some people?   Sometimes people need other people to help them work through their issues.  One day at a time. Small steps. Prioritise whats the most important issue.  Whats your issues?   Find out your interests. You can brainstorm a few on a piece of paper.  Spend 15 minutes at a time to sort problems out,"Hello Robert. I've recently read the book Freedom by Jeremy Griffith. It's about the Human condition and it tackles and gives answers to anxiety in a way that is clear.
It helped me to realise what I was going through(anxiety and depression).
The fact that your reaching out is your inner strength helping you, hold on to that and build on it. 
Also ,instead of listening to the ""can't or ""that won't work"" voice ,flip it over and ""do""
Hope this helps fella."
"Hi, everyone! I just want to share something, and I hope y'all can help me with this.
 
Recently, I've been thinking about how to completely distance myself from certain people I became ""close friends"" with in college after finding out that they're ""toxic"". 

It's been extremely difficult for me to adjust because we're in the same year, studied the same program, and went to the same university in college. Worse, we'll run into each other on campus at any time. I'm worried that if I get rid of them, they'll be upset with me.

This leads me to the point that I am having panic attacks every night because of overthinking, and it affects my mental health so badly.

So here's my question: Is it the best decision for my mental health to distance myself from them? What are some things I should do to make it less obvious?","You are doing the right thing. It's important to recognise that they weren't real friends at all. Think back to all the times that they have let you down. And think of WHY you are choosing to distance yourself in the first place. You deserve better. And to tell you the truth, it hurts at first. It hurts that you don't have friends to back you up in life. But I promise it gets better after time. You just ha e to go through the five stages of grief, denial, anger, Bargaining, Sadness and finally, Acceptance. Validate yourself and start enjoying spending your time alone, do activities and work on your social persona. After time, as you meet better people, you feel happy that you left those friends behind.","Hello there! It sounds like you're going through a challenging situation, and it's brave of you to seek help.

Prioritizing your mental health is essential. If you find these relationships to be toxic and detrimental to your well-being, it might be a valid choice to create some distance, but rather than abruptly cutting ties, gradually reduce the time spent together. This can make the process less obvious and give you the space you need."
No wonder that my illness has come back as one time that I had a friend but she only wanted to be a friend for a few months,💯 agree,Here for you if you ever want to talk you don’t have to go through this in your own 🤗

"Hello, I'm fairly new to the group. I don't usually post, I get very anxious when I do but i've been really struggling with my depression need to get this out. Without getting into detail... i currently live in a very toxic, emotionally abusive, household, that I currently have no way of getting out of, with my mom and step dad who has been diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (he wasnt told by our old family therapist, now my personal therapist, in fear of how he would react). It's extremely difficult to be open about my feelings because they are often ignored or downgraded. I often feel alone, trapped, unloved, and unsupported. These past couple of months have been extra difficult. I lost my job and ive been really struggling to find another. Ive applied to SO MANY jobs without any luck. Now getting basic necessities is getting difficult and ive started to loose hope of ever getting my own place. Im just so tired of trying so hard just to end up right back where I started. I finally felt like things were heading in the right direction. I'm trying so hard to hold on but im just tired of feeling so trapped and alone...","I am so sorry you are in this situation. It's so hard to look to the future when the present makes you feel so trapped. 

Have you sought help through your GP? Is it worth contacting your local council to see if you can start applying for universal credits so that you can at least rent a room somewhere to get out? X",Hey add me and follow my page at Infinite Nutrition I can help you like I've helped many others with anxiety/stress/depression
"I wish that I could find some motivation. I feel like I have no purpose, goals or anything useful to contribute to anything. Every day is hard work (I have chronic fatigue and pain) and nothing much to look forward to, except more of the same. Life is very stressful for hubby and I as we are dealing with his elderly and infirm parents who refuse to consider moving from their own house, despite being unable to look after themselves. We're 'on call' 24/7 for them as there's nobody else to help if they fall etc. I don't have the energy to do my own stuff like housework or self care, yet I'm still doing their laundry, groceries etc! They have no quality of life, and neither do we, but they can't see it. I'm tired, stressed and unhappy and starting to feel really resentful and frustrated, and guilty about my anger.",Can't you get a professional carer for your parents? They could keep each other company in a nursing home. You need to speak to your doctor about how you are feeling. You are burnt out. You need a social worker to help you organise care for your parents.,Hey all ❤️ hope you all are staying positive & having an amazing day… my buddy Mike just started his own page after years of in person work and is willing to help as many people as possible ❤️🙏🙌 @world.wide_peace on Instagram 🙏 he is incredible.

"Hi there I'm new, I was worried I wasn't going to be accepted due to being a new account but I do it because I don't want to admit my struggle to my family. Is it weird to live a secret depressed life from your loved ones? They always see me as being so strong and I like to keep it like that.","In fact, it's more common than not that we wear a proverbial mask around those close to us. Whether it is because we feel like we may be a burden or just don't want to talk about it.

The thing is, you can be strong and depressed simultaneously. Depressed doesn't always mean weak whilst it definitely feels like it.

I do advise talking to someone though so someone is aware. Whether it be a close one or a professional.","hey Lambriini Spencer, Thanks for sharing and asking for help! It is difficult to talk to friends and especially family about depression. I can't tell you how many times my parents had told me ""cheer up, try smiling"" as a cure for every mental challenge. Rely on your friends who understand, use groups like these with people who are going through the same. We understand and we will listen"

"My doctor prescribed Concerta for me, and I do not have ADHD. I have depression.. Has anyone ever heard of ADHD medications that treat diseases other than ADHD.. Can they really help me get rid of anhedonia and increase motivation and motivation? Those who have tried Concerta, is the drug really addictive because it is frequently cut off in the country? who live in it","Undiagnosed ADHD or ADD in adults often presents as anxiety and depression etc. This is a consequence of a lifetime spent trying to fit in and get on with life whilst being judged to be not good enough, no matter how hard we try, and being viewed as deliberately not cooperating or trying hard enough despite giving it 110%! A common feature is anhedonia. I've experienced periods of anxiety and depression since my childhood, including issues with food and body image. I became a mental health nurse, and only then did I realise that I probably had grown up with ADHD. I got my diagnosis at 48, and began Concerta. Since then, I've noticed that my depression and anxiety are much better, or rather I find challenging times much easier to manage, I get cross and frustrated with myself far less, and my other heath problems (chronic pain and fatigue due to autoimmune issues) are much improved. It could be that your doctor believes that you could have ADHD and your mental health issues are a symptom rather than a problem in their own right? On a more technical level, mental ill health has a complicated neurochemical side, people with ADHD have issues with their Dopamine levels in particular. Other neurotransmitters such as Seratonin are often also out of whack too. So, your Dr may be prescribing Concerta as a way of altering your neurotransmitter production & absorption. Please don't worry about becoming 'addicted', it's really not that bad.",Hey there I’m just checking in to see if you’re feeling any better?
"Hello! Posting for a friend who is not on Facebook. My brothers friend has issues with restlessness, high anxiety, agitation and sometimes sudden bursts of agression. Once the burst is over he falls in a “vacuum” of down emotions. Also, he, sometimes has unexpected feeling of sadness. He can be sitting down and talking to someone and then suddenly he experiences a deep feeling of sadness, for no reason. Then he jumps back to normal. He says it’s like the bursts overtake him and they are extremely difficult to manage. Now he went into therapy. He really wants to “fix” this and manage. If possible. He recently read that irritation, sudden mood changes can be also caused by a thyroid gland and/or can be related to kidneys as well? Is that possible? If so, what can he check? 

Any advice would be appreciated!

He was like this since he is a teen, he is 31 now. As a kid he had issues with concentration as well.","As someone who has  struggled with anxiety & depression and considered psilocybin mushrooms as a way to deal with it I’m actually kinda excited that it worked for me today and I have been living my normally like it use to be, taking a bold step without doubts saves sometimes and I'll encourage anyone to do so as well. In the other hand I thank mush_help on Instagram for letting me get my hands on this products and also for the satisfying guides he gave me, reach out to him if your life means a lot to you.","Hey there! I can relate to your friend's struggles. I've navigated similar challenges, and the turning point for me was discovering the balancing effects of mushroom capsules from botanico_remedies on IG. These capsules have been a consistent source of support, especially with restlessness and sudden mood shifts. Encourage your friend to give them a try—it might just make a positive difference. 🍄💙"
"Please forgive me for my rambling post, I'm hoping that maybe I might feel better for it. For years I've been hiding behind a false persona. Pretending to be happy when I'm not and then when I am happy by actively thinking of things depressing.
For 12 years now I've had a well and truly dodgy heart. Multiple and I mean multiple 13+ heart attacks, arrythmia problems with multiple operations, a shredded femeral artery  and a triple bypass during lockdown.
The bypass helped fix things on the plumbing side but ruined the results of all my operations for arrythmia problems.
I now have one access point in case of an emergency angio.
Last April I had a nstemi which is a heart attack that doesn't show on an ECG.
My angio was clear but extremely painful.
All this aggro has resulted in depression with a bit of PTSD thrown in.
Last July it got too much and I took an overdose.
Things were getting a bit better after discharge but I find it impossible to tell the people I love and trust the most my real feelings.
Instead I will just jump in the car and disappear for a few hours and even a couple of days, just sleeping in the car not eating or drinking.
Today I took the mother in law to an appointment in Bedford.
When I left her it took me 6 hours to do a 3 mile journey.
I just couldn't handle going back home.
Something inside just switches off.
It's got to the stage again where I'm starting to think that everyone would be better of without me.
I will probably seek help again in the morning but it's so difficult getting the help.
I find it difficult to speak to the professionals and am always on the guard and hiding my feelings.
I do sometimes wish that I just drop off to sleep at night and never wake up.
Anyway I've put this post up because I'm at my wits end and I know that some others among you all may relate to this.
I don't know where I'm going to go from here but the stubborn streak in me is still pushing me forward

A few months ago, we visited a psychiatrist, and she thinks my daughter has a mood disorder or epilepsy but not schizophrenia. If I understand correctly, a mood disorder is a combination of many mental illnesses. She also shows no signs of bipolar disorder. 

My 15-year-old daughter has been hallucinating since a very young age, around 5 years old, experiencing command hallucinations and visual hallucinations. This is the only symptom she has. She is on medication for epilepsy because it helps with mood disorders as well. The voice is about 60% gone.

On the 24th of December we were at the cinema. The previews played for a few seconds when my daughter couldn't handle the darkness and loud noises. We immediately left. On the way home, the voice appeared.

the voice reappeared, saying, ""hello (and my daughter's name)."" My daughter told it to go away, and then it started saying nonsensical words. It went away after a while. 

She will be fine and next moment the ""voice"" appears..😢😭
My heart breaks for my child!

Her father has epilepsy. She struggles with anxiety from a very young age and recently depression. We also have biopolar in the family. But no one hallucinates

Do you think these are signs of schizophrenia or epilepsy?",There are a lot of mental illnesses that cause hallucinations even severe depression can cause them.,"Hi I'm sorry about your daughter,it all sounds very complex..with all that's going on with your daughter it's must be very depressing for her to have multiple things going on. I'm no expert but if it continues, depression will probably be setting in and and this can cause voices and other hallsinations to happen! Just a question..can you see visual sighns that your daughter is hearing voices like sudden head  movements before she tells the voices to ""go away"" it could be a small dose of antidepressants and antipsycotics just to keep a lid on it all! I'm not a great belivor in meds but they helped me. Ask the doctor or pop to a&e if it continues..good luck"

"Just word vomit no advice necessary I think but feel free to input:

I think…. I’m slowly feeling sad again, lonely and bored 

Tbh I know my social battery gets drained but like I’m not even sure if I fit into introvert term anymore this happen since 2020 aka bad times( if  ya know ya know) I became weirdly social( but if overdone it I get overwhelmed) and it was awful because everywhere I tried to go I’d get picked on except this group chat on messenger if ya know ya know which I highly appreciate

But also If overdone I get stimulated which is why I go AWOL on everywhere nowadays 

But ye I also need to stop being skeptical and socialize more 

I need balance of real life( which recently  I’m getting) and online socialization more 

I can’t overthink or I’ll get fried but good luck to me I suppose 

I’m healing I just need to forget those who hurt me in the past to restart something new honestly and stop with fears

"Hi all,

I joined this group to find some new and advice per say. As of recently and really this has been going on for years, but I haven’t felt a drive. From sleeping a lot to minimal motivation it is really killing me. I’ve always felt embarrassed and upset at myself due to the way that I feel and how I’ve been operating. Losing my dad to suicide at 15 years old surely didn’t help (22 years of age now), but quite honestly I don’t think about it much anymore. Moved away from my hometown a year ago to another state the loneliness and depression has surely kicked back in. Going to college and trying to meet new people is hard for me. Being an introverted nerd, artist, and art collector I am I have found it extremely hard. Have always felt like a popular loner and quite frankly left out of events and such. Everytime I meet someone at college and get their phone number it always feels as if I pry a conversation with someone. My apologies for the longer post.

Thanks all,

Shane","Hi Shane 🙂

It seems you had some rough times but it is important to keep moving forward as you are doing at the moment by continuing your education and having cool hobbies. 😊

It is tough. And painful… but I find it helpful to get busy. Meeting friends. Start a new hobby. Reading. Walk in the park (the greens always calms me down). Workout. I find group classes works as I tend to get mind focus to catch up.  

Do things that keep you busy. At the same time allow self to grieve. Acknowledge your emotions… don’t suppress.

My health issues are that I had ADHD when I was young which i might still have and mild Epilepsy since I was 10 and Anxiety with depression since my mum passed away 12 years ago.  Also through social services cognitive assessment I have streaks of Autism and also it takes a long time for my brain to process things and a reading age of 13 which I agree because I can only read a couple of paragraphs then stop before carrying on.

So is there anyone that can help please.",I have a disability and I had two children that both got taken away but from birth not from an older age. The authorities took them both from me and from my partner saying all kinds of things. From saying that we would be neglectful to even blaming the house. Saying that it would not be safe for a child. They never gave us a chance to parent at home only in a contact centre or a parent and child unit. Which did not seem to work either. Neither one of us got the child back and even family did not get the child. This happened twice but even though the second time was not completely the same as the first it still ended in the same result. I had to carry two children for nine whole months and then for people to act like you were having the children for them and we got no compensation from them either. I also had two abortions and a miscarriage to add to the issue. The problem was is that I am on the autistic spectrum and my partner was alcohol dependent. They had their worries and they had their concerns about us. They even said that my score was not good enough and that my partner was not supportive enough. So how would that of worked? So it was just me and him in the end just having a relationship with each other and having children to give away.,"Hi, there are clearly some things you have raised that are birth issues, so my question is - I'm here, what would you like help with?"

"So.. I don't really know where to start with this. 

I've been with my husband for 12 years, married for 4 and we have a 1 and a half year old little boy. 
We've suffered 3 miscarriages and 1 23 week old loss of our little boy due to me getting pre-eclampsia, unfortunately our first little boy lived for 4 days before he died. 

Since our 2nd little boy was born, and especially since he got a bit more aware of the world, my husband hasn't really ever bonded with him. He doesn't know how to play with him, doesn't know his routine, what he eats for dinner, even though I update him every day on how he's been when he's with me. I work part time so I can spend more time with my little boy and this works for us. 

Anyway.. fast forward to the last few month, my little boy is going through an absolutely terrible time with sleep, he's up all through the night, some nights I take him downstairs at 3 in the morning until around 7am when he falls back to sleep, and we have tried EVERYTHING to try and get him to sleep better and nothing works. 

My husband is absolutely terrible. He shouts, he throws stuff in anger, he has been known to headbutt doors, punch and break things around the house. He's never hurt me or our son ever and if he ever did, well.. I'd be gone in a shot. 

But.. lastnight, our little boy was up and down from 12-3 and my husband was up with him because he's not working and I was today so I needed sleep. My little boy woke up at 3.30am and it was me who went downstairs with him even though I was meant to be in work at 8am. My little boy was still awake when I left for work so you can imagine how shattered I am today. 
When my husband is working, he goes mad if I don't take my son downstairs because 'he was to work and I'm at home in the day time'

Anyway, when I got my pants on to go downstairs, my husband turned to me and said I'd be buggered for work to which I replied, well.. you're not taking him downstairs so I can sleep seeing as I've got work, so it's down to me.. his reply 'well you didn't even ask' and then persisted to call me a d***head as I went downstairs.. then, when he came waltzing downstairs at 6.15am this morning, my son took a book to him and my son got 'if you think I'm reading that, you've another thing coming'

This isn't normal behaviour is it? 
He speaks to me like absolute crap most of the time. What do I do?",We can speak together if you want. You can send me a pm 🙂,"His emotionally and verbally abusing you. It could be why your little boy is so, unsettled. Your experiencing domestic abuse. I don't think you need me to tell you it's time to get out of this relationship. Your post tells me that you know this deep down already. Don't need me or anybody else to validate that. Your capable you do everything on your own anyway."

But, the trick is that first it has to come from you towards yourself. 

Once you accomplish that, good men will be flying in your life and will treat you right because you will treat yourself that way and that is what you will project. 

I promise you that!

Sending all my love 😉"
"TRIGGER WARNING - Dr*g misuse & cheating. 

I just need a rant aswell as a little advice. I appreciate it’s a long post but I really really need to get it off my chest as it’s affecting my mental health   💔 

So I’ve been with my partner for 7 years now. We are in a same s€x relationship. I have been physically cheated on with at least 6 different women and have caught her talking to probably 5 other women throughout these 7 years. I’ve took her back every single time because I love her and have always seen the best in her. This isn’t a trauma bond, I have been through therapy and established that this isn’t why I haven’t left. It’s been my choice. My partner also was a recovering addict and throughout the years she’s had many relapses and most of them I’ve caught her doing it or just know from how she’s acting. So this weekend we had an event to attend and we’ve been great at the minute. Everything running smooth (our kids getting on) and our relationship is stable. Last time we went to a similar event she got dr*gged up and took p!lls. She completely embarrassed me and she promised me for this event she wouldn’t touch anything. We’re sat at this table and I notice she keeps licking her lips, won’t stay still and just chatting absolute crap. I look in her eyes and instantly think she’s took dr*gs. I choose to ignore it because other people are around and don’t want to cause a scene. Next thing she asks if I want a drink. I say yes she gets up to get one. 20 minutes later I’m sat there like a spoon on my own like where tf is she? So I go looking for her and she’s at a bar chatting crap with random people with a drink for herself! I kinda lost it and was like are you taking the effing p*ss!! I’ve been sat on my own and your over here with a drink for yourself forgetting I’m sat over there waiting for a drink you offered me?? I walk back to the table with her after she gets me a drink and then she goes I need the toilet. I was like right ok. Off she goes. HALF AN HOUR passes and I’m about to loose my sh!t. I walk to the toilets and I walk round the corner and she’s walking out the disabled toilets with another woman she called “her friend she hasn’t seen in years”. I DONT CARE!? Your a grown a$$ woman why you coming out the toilet together?? I instantly lost my sh*t and was like “we’re going”. I walk ahead and turn around and she didn’t even follow me she walked to the bar with this woman she just walked out the toilets with to get a drink! I ended up shouting at her and didn’t care who heard because I felt like she was taking the mick out of me. I wasn’t embarrassed this time round but I was hurt. She lied about taking dr*gs and even when I approached her the night after she still lied to my face about it. She just has an excuse to justify everything. I feel pretty numb towards her right now. I always think I know her turns out I don’t know who she is. I look at her ever since this event and I’m like who even are you? I’m looking at a person that thinks she can do what the hell she wants to me and get away with it. She don’t care how anything makes anyone feel she does what she wants. I just don’t know what to do. We’ve been together a long while and there are kids involved. I don’t want to be the one to break up the family but I really don’t trust her anymore. Not with dr*gs not with woman, nothing. I’ve been fine recently regarding anxiety lately and just got over the last time she cheated on me and now I’m feeling sick and anxious and over thinking again. Please can people give me some advice. Am I over reacting about the weekend? Or was she taking the absolute p!ss out of me! I don’t know what to do… especially so close to Christmas 😔 please any advice welcome or at least some validation.",Drink and drugs and other people obviously come first then,"honestly sometimes it's best to leave and break up the family so they either realize what they've lost and straighten up or they continue drugs/alcohol. They'll make their choice very clear to you if you just stick to it. If you stay you'll just get worse mentally, I did. You'll drive yourself crazy cause the overthinking won't stop and it'll get worse, even have you questioning yourself. My thoughts are with you because this is pain like no other. You will get through this love."

"Hey friends if anyone is free to talk that would be swell

That's all 🥺",Hello 👋,hope you ok
Does everyone on mirtazepine put on weight? It’s making me so hungry and I’m finding it hard to control my appetite. It’s lifting my depression a little bit so far but if I put on loads of weight that’s going to make me miserable. Any experience of this?,"I've heard this is quite common with some anti-depressants, hope someone else can advise you with personal experience of taking them. Maybe visit your doctor to see if there's an alternative if not or ways to help manage the hunger, it's a vicious circle, good luck x",Hopefully it’ll be a short term thing I personally can’t take any of the prescribed anti depressants
"I feel that we are all struggling at this moment.
Prices, values & expectations.","I understand and do leverage all of us, for support","Hopefully, we can support each other"
"Hi there. I'm not sure if I'm wording this correctly but when people need support with addiction etc, there are services in place for that person to check into and access the support they need. When someone is having a mental health crisis, is there such a place you can check into and just take a break from everything, reset and heal? I've seen retreats on Google to help with mental health problems, but you have to pay for them. I'm a single Mum of 6 and don't have that kind of money, is there somewhere free or very low cost? I'm in Lancashire. Thanks",Contact your local ‘family centre’ (if you’re not sure where that is then check out your County/District council website under ‘children/families) or Home Start (via their national website) organisation. They will be able to give you some information on any services within your area. X,Hospital
When I’m feeling really anxious and panicky and tearful like I am now I just want someone to be there for me and give me support and I have no one no one I can phone and tell things to who’s knows me and it’s really hard and I’m struggling,Are you seeing a therapist is there an outpatient patient program in your city  I get very anxious the only thing that helps is coloring I use gel pins and coloring books that have small pictures I am able to focus and not get so anxious and panicky,How about phoning lifeline aS they are so friendly
Any advice please. I am plagued every day by constant intrusive loud thoughts and also tension. It's really really painful physically and its making me really grouchy. I'm always taking random pills to make it go away. I feel I have no friends. I'm 34 with no job. I moved back to my flat from mum and dad's and I have found out that the neighbours are drug dealing. They keep harassing me all the time. It is the lady downstairs. She basically won't leave me alone because she knows I know and I feel I can't live there knowing she is there alone with me downstairs in the flat. Also there is a black audi that is parked outside watching. I feel I can't be myself. I keep getting face ache and tension aches. I feel I have lost my happy self now. I'm just stuck in my old room at my folks.,If you want to talk please pm me,How are you doing?
Could really do with a chat feeling very low,Everything okay?,How are you getting on? What are you doing today? Has something happened to make you feel sad? Ask for support from professionals or anyone close to you. Sometimes family and friends don't understand. Do you have a voluntary counselling service in your area? Keep in touch. Good luck
So how is everyone feeling today?  Its better to let it out!,Sad,How can we turn a corner in this when there are still people being ignorant about the 2 meter rule and staying home. The more they listen the quicker  we can get some normality back in this country.
I am not feeling to good today with voices and depression,Sorry you're having a hard time I have the voices constantly.it's hard work..feel like ending it all..every day is a battle wish I could be well..love to you..,How do you get on with your medication? Have you anything fun to do? Have you family and friends?
"Hi everyone, I've looked up this group for some advice. My neighbour is a a single mom who struggles really bad with her mental health. The reason for this post is because she has a meeting with dwp next week and they have told her she can't have luxury things like Netflix also days out and so much more. They told her she has to cancel things like her her gym membership that was advised from doctor to go to gym. Surely this isn't right. Hoping someone can advise. TIA 😊",So tell her to go to citizens advice because they can't tell her not to go to the gym if its helps her and also tell her to go to the doctors and get a note to say going to the gym helps her mental health.,How does the dwp what she spends her money on? You claim for your disability not for what you need extra money. Perhaps these things help her with her mental health. Has she seen a psychiatrist to help with her claim? Does she have children?
Got my pip review today between 9 & 9.30,"Phone call or face to face ?

"I'm really struggling. I'm undergoing lots of medical testing for chronic pain, but going round in circles.  I'm leaving my job due to bullying but even during my notice period they are being passive aggressive, I can't just leave, due to the nature of the role and financial repercussions and I'm miserable. I feel so hopeless, clinging on for the sake of my family but finding it hard to feel happy any of the time 😔",Why don’t you see a therapist maybe you can tell her what you just told us no one should bare the burden you are enduring you need support I don’t if you believe in God but trust Jesus is there with even if you don’t believe,How much longer do you have to wait? Can you get a sick note from your doctor?
I can't cope no motivation to do anything. All I want to do is lie in bed. My anxiety and depression has been triggered off by my bank account being locked due fraudulent activity and them not updating me. I feel I need to go to the doctors tomorrow. I don't know what to do.,Keep your head up if u want to talk let me no,How was doctors
Could someone please chat with me. I'm having a awful bad day with feeling depressed.,Also probably not best time to do all this think about it when depressed but do something that just makes you ok for today then on a fresh day think about above.,How you feeling today ?

"While anxiety is something we all experience in the face of stress, whether we are taking exams or going to a social event, when anxiety prevents you from living your life and looking after yourself then you most likely have an anxiety disorder. You may experience symptoms like stomach aches and IBS, headaches and panic attacks, all indicators of an anxiety disorder.

What's everyone been up to today?,Been doing my diamond art painting thinggy. Been a good distractions ish for the past few days.,I actually went shopping a bit nervous but OK x

"So my mental health is going down hill again and I am trying so hard to get it under control.. in May 2020 I took a overdose and ended up on life support because I died twice... it all started in April 2020 when people where I live started causing trouble with me I told my housing association and they said they can't do anything about it and told me to write it down so I did that every day and every night they was out stalking me plotting and a lot more so I rang the police and that made it worse on me I rang the housing and still no help from them.... Anyway then I heard a housing staff member talking about me and laughing behind my back about it all she was helping them some lad wanted to climb up to my window and she the staff member said you will fall laughing he said I will give you £80 for the window.. so I told the police. I have emails I've sent to my local councillor, my local MP, I even got Resolver on the case to and no end of emails and phone calls to the housing association. And when I took my overdose in May 2020 I was put back into the same situation and once again no help from them at all. So the other day I got a letter saying that they are taking me to court for my rent arrears also I pay service charges to so I sent them an email stating that I would pay my rent but I'm not paying for the service because I don't get any so I added up the amount of service charges and I sent them an email with the new rent arrears I owe. And told them that's all ya getting off me and told them about the situation where I have been told by a tenant that the housing staff member was telling people about my business she been doing it from day 1 so I put that in the email and wow I got a message saying that its at stage 1 formal investigation. I sent a email regarding that and I told them this should of been sorted out in 2020 but you left me to kill myself you left them to harasses me and my complaints never even got dealt with so your 3 years to late... now this housing woman wants a meeting with me to discuss the issues I've been having still 3 years to late. I have all my complaints since day 1 and I have even found the book I was told to write wow I can't believe what I wrote it made me cry reading it that's how bad it was... so my question is do I have a meeting with her and tell her about the staff member situation and my mental health.. or do I just take it further and sue the housing association to get compensation for everything they have caused me.. oh not to mention the cctv camera they have put up on my boundary wall and guess what it sees my whole back garden and my back door and another cctv camera at the front that faces my front door and I can see it from my landing window and kitchen window to I've got pictures of that so they can't lie like they do some of my emails has been lost to but I have every email from day 1.. so what should I do about it do I have a meeting with them and record them without them knowing or sue the housing.. all I want is a place I can feel safe and get my mental health under control without feeling like a victim in my home... But also I have been told I should meet up tell them everything and see what they say. Then tell them I'm not happy with your response so I'm taking you to court for composition as I know my rights.. or don't take the housing association to court and tell them what I want for the pain and suffering that you have caused me from 2020 and say this is what I want... I want to move to where I want and what property I want.. also I know they have new properties for rent soon to.. so is a new property worth the price for what I've been thought 🤔 or drag them to court and take my story to the papers which they already have been by another tenant of their's couple of years ago 🤔 
So following my situation with this do I give them the meeting and tell them what I want the outcome to be or not meet and take it to court and sue them 🤔 could someone please help me with this please.. thank you for reading and I hope that someone can help me with this please 🙏","Hey man that was intense, thanks so much for sharing, I don’t want to give bad advice because you’ve already been through so much, but your main focus should be you, your mental health, so taking on a housing association isn’t something that would likely help.
With that in mind I would first seek free legal advice, in the UK we have citizens advice bureau, I’m not sure if you’re from the UK but if not, perhaps your country provide a similar service?
If not contact a legal representative, and have them take over your correspondence with the housing association.
They will have the best advice for that situation.
If your doctor is aware of your situation, they can contact them too and build a strong case for you.

Your mental health is more important than anything else.
Your focus needs to be on you, let others fight some battles for you because you don’t have to fight them all yourself",I agree as above don't take it all on yourself too much stress too intense. Get someone to do this for you and have someone at the meeting if u do go ahead.  Also maybe letter from Dr's re your mental health deterioration living there etc.
I went out this morning to met new people but I will not be going to tell them about my illness as u don't know who to trust,Yes don't tell your personal story to strangers. Wait until you get to know them,I agree I wouldn’t tell them anything I have a trust issue myself my sisters don’t aren’t supportive I have three friends that do over the years I began to trust them now I can get support
,This is me ,I agree with you 100%
Mental health day doesn’t exist. To me every day is mental health day,Amen to that.,"I agree with you! 

I think that mental health is the most important thing in life because without your mental health, the rest of life can feel impossible and hopeless. 

Mental health is a priority every day, and we should always make sure that we take good care of our mind, body and spirit ❤️"
I have been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 11 I’m now 21 it has all got worse and worse over the years and I overthink everything sometimes I can’t breathe properly from it and I’m worried when I go out in public everyone looks at me cause I’m ugly I have intrusive thoughts of things I feel like I can’t control and I feel guilty and I tell my partner about them because sometimes they are sexual thoughts with other people or fucked up things I see in my head and my partner he feels like leaving me because of what I have told him I am suicidal a lot of the time I feel I have so much problems that It’s not worth living because it’s so hard to deal with them all I also have no friends because of my problems I don’t like to meet new people and am very introverted I feel so worthless alone and horrible sorry to write all this but I needed to get it out I don’t see anyone regularly yet for help bunt I plan on it ASAP 😞,"A lot of mental health issues exacerbate in ones early 20's.

"WHAT TO DO ABOUT A FRIEND THAT lives in a life dominated by DRAMA, and is always needing MONEY to solve his SELF INFLICTED DRAMA. Is there a way to see I asm not responsible for BAILING HIM OUT, and make him see his is the MOST DESTRUCTIVE FORCE in his life. 

I am out of ideas.

On behalf of your friend I apologize for the behaviour. When trapped in a cycle and life has no meaning or purpose it is so difficult to change.

"How do we develop confidence and build relationships? Any tips?

I'm nearly 40, been in UK  for over 15 years, I'm shy,  kind of introvert.

English is not my first language however I speak good English and generally have no issues, I am educated to master degree.

I work in a senior management role in major company.

I have generally no issues in formal meetings or one to one informal chats.

I feel often left out, not able to join others when there are group conversations. I really try to mix but it just does not work. I try but I can't mix, I don't have accent, fluency, words to talk like native British.

Almost everyone is born in UK in my company, they talk about all sort of things, make jokes but I just can't do this, I am not confident to have jokes with others and scared to get them wrong. English is their 1st language as they born here so they can not understand what I'm going through.

I end up sitting on my desk while everyone else is talking to each other. I seriously get depressed, not able to crack jokes and informal chats.

All my conversations are mostly serious, to the point and work related so people don't get close to me as such.

When others are having group chats, I feel like it will embarrass me with my broken English. They keep joking with each other which I mostly understand but can't make such jokes.

There is no one at level I'm in career who speaks just dictionary English and not born here in UK.

I have lot of potential and can develop in my career but this feeling of being isolated, lack of confidence is major obstacle. I often leave office depressed and someone left out.

Thank you for your understanding.","First of all, your written English is amazing, far superior to my French or Arabic! And I'm sure your spoken English is the same standard.

I think there's a need first of all to accept that you are not going to be able to interact with your British colleagues in the way you want to. And that's ok. You are enough as you are. 

Also realise that you don't need to be funny to be accepted. Being kind and principled counts for far more. 

Let us know how you get on 👍",I am the same :(

"Can we talk about Mental Health Abuse? I worked with Melissa Farrell, at Spectrum Health and Human Services, until 2/17/2023. During that time, she falsified my chart, attempted treatment on me that she not trained for. During treatment, she left for over 4 months. She is verbally & emotionally abusive. She was manipulative & controlling & would be upset when I didn't do as she says. When I try to express myself, she would stop me from voicing my thoughts, to a point where she omits what I said & write her version of sessions. I am retraumatize & find myself questioning my own self-worth if a professional person in the mental health field would be so intentionally hurtful, what does that say about my worth as person & or even human being. I am finding it hard to move forward & struggling to go about my normal day caring for myself & family. Melissa’s actions were intentional reckless & never considered how her actions would affect me. I didn't work with a professional, but rather a self-serving person looking out only for herself & how our time working together would be beneficial to her. I was treated by Farrell with zero respect, she lacks integrity, decency and honesty! Recently I was called in by the CEO, Cindy Voelker who threatened me. She began by telling me how Melissa was close longtime friend. She repeated several times that she doesn’t believe her friend would do such a thing, but if she did it was not intentional. She then told me that if I continue with this complaint, she would make things difficult for me moving forward. CEO Cindy Voelker specifically told me that if I continue this complaint that she would see to it that I would be painted as a liar, mentally unstable, delusional, making this whole thing up or it simply being a she said, she said situation and I had no proof, which I actually do.","The whole system is broken, I actually believe that freemasons have infiltrated most organisations, sounds paranoid but I have had some bad 3xperiences myself with doctors and other so called professionals.. there are some good ones out there though, you just have find them, otherwise look for your own solutions, I know that's hard and depending on situations sometimes impossible but breathwork, yoga and dance have helped me, art, maybe looking at taking a different route through counselling maybe.. I get books from the library on cbt or differing therapies to help myself and to learn more and to find different ways to help myself, I sort of stopped relying on 'professionals' years ago..","I applaud your bravery and honesty to name and shame them. Stay safe. They like to keep you quiet, you know. Soon as you become a threat to them they will shut you down and you will not exist."

"When you want out of life, remember this I wrote this to someone very special in my life and I hope it helped.

When darkness clouds my heart and mind,
And all I want is to leave it all behind,
I think of the ones who need me so,
My children and family who love me, I know.

Their smiles and laughter light up my day,
And in their love, I find my way,
Through the toughest times and darkest nights,
Their love and support are my guiding lights.

I may feel unloved and unworthy at times,
But their love and presence are like chimes,
That ring out, reminding me to stay,
And fight through the pain, day by day.

Their love is the anchor that keeps me grounded,
Their hugs and kisses, the warmth that surrounds me,
And in their love, I find the strength to carry on,
To face the world with a brave face, and a song.

So when I feel lost and alone,
And wish that I could go away, unknown,
I think of my children and family who need me to stay,
And in their love, I find the courage to face another day.",Beautiful,I Care
"Hmmm I keep wondering even tho I’m okay whenever I care about my mom it’s draining like I try to be civil and all only to receive criticism and all

At this point I tried all I don’t care why you shove me away if it’s mental problems get help deal with it 

I need to remember I’m my own person and stop being there for others so much 

I am thankful for what she did so far but if ita whenever we interact ur gonna be hostile and give me anxiety then I’m done",I get this when you get drained from helping other people or family .You have to look at your own health first .That’s not being selfish if you are unwell then can’t be there for you mum X,I chose myself and walked away.

How does someone discover their passion?,Omar Makhlouf What did you love doing as a kid? What could you find joy in doing all day if money wasn’t an option? What do your friends and family call you for most? Ask the three closest people to you what you are great at doing? When you get those answers start exploring in what areas can you tap into those abilities the most. Then see what feels the most right to you. Whatever continues to flow continue to flow with it and see where it takes you. I hope this helps!,I did and then I lost it due 2 my mental health and other health issues

Anyone else feel like they want to run away and not look back even if it means leaving your whole world behind and the only thing that’s holding you back is that you have no where else to go? #mindgames,I tell if your overwhelmed find a place where you can run away for the whole day if it’s just to rest okay if it’s to plan for things you would never do that’s okay must be rated G the point is to leave every thing behind and enjoy that day give yourself a day to run away every month one day,I did this and it’s the worst decision of my life now feeling more isolated and lonely than I’ve ever been so my advice is don’t do it what ever the issue just talk
I can't understand why people do kill themselves as I have try a lots of times as I have heard from a friend of mine who lives the other side of London and they have just got back from a holiday with some friends but I don't have any one to go with and it makes me very sad,It’s hard to be lonely do you have neighbors do you go to church usually these are places that are pretty safe I didn’t have anyone at one time but I preferred it that way i didn’t trust anyone I tried to reach out to my family I got shot down my ex husband ended up leaving it took years to make friends at outpatient programs I am learning to trust others especially God he’s always there he loves me  Jesus died for me it changed my life I am going to celebrate recovery at my church it’s a good program you might be able to look for it on the internet it took courage to show your emotions,I did try church but it was not for me as I also found that it went on far to go

"Heya everyone , I just wanted to let you all know i wrote this during hard times to self motivate.
When your filled with unbalance and roughness of your own trauma and stress you may feel up alone in the battle but it's ok to feel that your not ok when your struggling to get yourself pulled together in your trauma and tensions being lost missing stages of yourself anxiety is the only thing that you could have allowed to take hold to allow you to be battles giving to your trauma. I don't know how to cope with going forth to my own issues if I can't look and figure solutions out I am seriously tearing up inside myself cause of my own trauma and there's nothing to help me cope and it's ok to not cope and not feel ok I know I'm only alone in my tensions battles and it's better to have me alone isolated and alone coping pains and traumatic stress of everything then letting it not be balanced out in a way. I am so fed up and running down to tears in myself often to know how to keep fighting my emotions inside myself.","Rather than fighting your emotions, observe them. 
At some point you will realise that they are just emotions and then you can use them to motivate yourself.

"Hi, I was wondering if you can offer me some help and advice please. Sorry for long post.
My husband of 15 years was running our restaurant for the last 8 years. He was the pillar of this business,  working lots of hours, dealing with problems and the stresses of running business like that. I was mainly in the background and looking after the house and kids, occasionally taking active role in running of the business.
Additionally, our son was born 6 years ago and has got a life limiting heart condition which meant long hospital stays, 3 open heart surgeries, lots of hospital visits ect. This really affected us as a family. 
Recently my husband started behaving rather erratically. He kept saying to me on more than one occasion that our staff is doing everything to ruin our business, they don't listen to him, do opposite, play tricks on him, then it escalated to accusations that they work on someone's instruction to take over the business, even poison him. I wanted to reason with him, but he started saying that I am behind this too. At some point he refused to go to work, I took over the bast I could.
The accusations started to affect our family life, he is saying our kids are not his (said it to them, they are 6 and 11). They I have a man in my life, my mother is plotting against him, his parents are only using him, kids behave badly. I asked him to leave the house and I refuse to let him come back until he seeks mental health help, but all this is escalating and I am leaning towards divorce. I feel like he needs help, but he refuses and claims he is behaving normally. Gp, mental health crisis team say he needs to consent. I do not know where to turn and how to help him and us. Any suggestions what to do, where to turn please?","If you really believe in Vedic astrology,i have noticed throat and sacral energy chakras blocked in you cause of some toxic enmity around you in the past,if you want me to tell you more in depth you can inbox me with a picture of your right Palm thank you...","I don't normally slide into DM,s strictly only when the universe permits ase🧿🙏⭐"

"I'm struggling right now,I took sick 3yrs ago which took me out of my career but I feel like I've lost my identity",It’s hard to adjust accept and create a new life.. but just believe in yourself and enjoy some of those things you always dreamed of having the time. Your id is still you as a base it’s just the dressing as in the cherry on top that has changed.  I got lymes disease from a tick visiting family in Florida… 6yrs it still affects me at times - but I just have to be me - so have great empathy with you… it’s a new year a new day and we should be feeling alright….hope this helps.🙏🙏🙏,I feel like I lost my relationship with God

What are your thoughts about an extended lockdown? Are you happy or sad?,Agitated but it's for the best,"I feel sad for nature when the lockdown is lifted, in a way it’s nice the planet gets to breathe a bit. However not wishing the worst to happen I just hope the world has learnt we can do things differently."
"I am going through horrible emotional pain and can't stop crying or get out of bed. I helped a man out who was homeless by letting him move in (he was from 2 states away and was going through alot) to which we began a relationship also. I helped him find a jobs and he got on at the volunteer fire dept in my town. Two months in and he began to be lazy, not want to help with bills, and just very emotional unavailable and ungrateful. He had me so drained and disconnected from myself and my kids even noticed it. Well this past Friday he left in the morning for work as usual, gave me a hug and kiss and said I'll see you later but that's the last I heard or saw of him. I called several times with no answer only a text from a weird number saying leave him be. I'm so hurt right now that he would do me that way after all I did too help him and just need someone to talk to before I end up in a hospital","Can't rely on a person who is homeless, they have a lot of problems as you have found out they cannot hold down normal life and relationships, now it is time to heal yourself from this and move forward, hope you feeling better soon x",I feel similar for similar&different reasons.   We lucked out yrs ago with Elgin whose now in jail normt for  the worest if crimes considering he's young but ya.   As for rick I dunno but what occured to me is something going on in my life though sounds like u may be closer or longer connected to this person then I am with this other guy however perhaps actually this the way to say. Maybe someone hurt his reputation knowing his past not his current ways. Maybe he regressed or relapsed  I dunno
I have literally giving up on life but I can't go because I've got a teenager daughter who needs me,"Leanne, I am completey where you are... If it wasn't for my kids I'd be gone by now. And last night would have been the night. I'm distraught tired and I've had enough. I walked halfway around Liverpool last night just trying to get away from myself... And ended up in a bar alone just drinking. A d as I did that, I lost one of my best mates over everything that has been going on which might not sound huge but I have very few friends where I live.

I know how hard it is. My boyfriend just up and left me out of nowhere and I found out he's been talking to someone else for the past 2 months.

But I've survived the past 3 weeks of complete chaos for my kids. And you will too. My inbox is open if you need a chat. Xx",I feel the exact same except my daughter is only a toddler 😒I’d never do that but my mental health is really bad lately😢😞if you need someone to talk to I’m here xxxx
I now know how utterly alone feels.....,You're not alone. I promise you this,I feel the same a lot of the time. I try and take my mind off by getting involved in other things and giving messages of support to others if may help. You have joined this group and that's going to help and be a positive thing.
I'm going to leave this group as everyday i cant stop crying I'm in such a dark place and feel like there is no way out I want to give up the reason why I feel like this is because i did some thing stupid and now I'm getting alot of rubbish for it,"My inbox is always open, if you need a friend xx",I feel your pain I am in the same situation I never thought life could be so hard.
"It’s been a very tough week since I ended my relationship with him and completely got him out of my life. I know I did the right thing but it hurts so much and idk when I’m going to heal. Every time I feel I’m getting better, the desperation and sadness always come back and overwhelm me again and again.
For the past week I stayed in bed all days not wanting to do anything even tho there’s work needed to be done. My emotions changed constantly and every time I cried I felt like I’m in hell. Even tho I pulled myself together and cooked, it took me a long time to force myself to finish the food. 
I think I just really need a hug and someone by my side but I have no close friend here and I don’t even know how to find a therapist. I know I’m free to do anything that cheers me up but I’m also feeling imprisoned in my own world.
I don’t know why I’m writing this here but I really want to feel alive again.",Doing the right thing isn't always easy. It's hard roller coaster road but you know it's for the best and you've got an amazing future ahead of you. Doing the right thing slow and steady and taking care of yourself even though it's the hardest thing right now. Virtual hugs,"I feel your pain, but just go for a walk. It will make you feel better. Smile at someone you meet  and say hello...sometimes, just being positive for a short while can change our well being x sending love, and remember,  ""this too will pass""..take each day one at a time x"
I'm literally losing my mind right now thanks to my household I want peace I want sleep like usual no one to talk too😭😭,"Yes that happened to me but, this group helped me where a group participant posted about someone (dings_trip) on instagram and I followed him.

"Needing help, feeling extremely uncomfortable,  i need to talk, struggling with self harm erges,  i need support,  struggling unable to open up to family,  or get theapy,  i need to find a way to express myself,  yet im not able too. 

I keep coming back to ringing a helpline yet I don't know how much that will help.",Ringing the Samaritan's can b a huge help xx,I finally. Called the Samaritans for the first time tonight. I wasn't expecting much. But now my self harm is going to be in the form of calories rather than blood. Give them a call
Tired of being lonely. Looking for someone to talk to.,"Sorry, i hope you are okay, this is a passing phase.",I find Christmas the most difficult time of year not only because I’ve absolutely no friends and no one I can trust or talk to in person
"Hopefully one of these days I have enough motivation to put my headphones blast loud music turn on my LED lights and dance to let out my demons 

I seen doing that is therapy but I’m not sure 

I wanna hear what you guys think",As long as you don’t bother the neighbors and you don’t go deaf why not dance to your heart content not that you need to  you might lose weight as a bonus,I find doing jigsaw puzzles helps all so making music as I do videos for the mind body and soul as I love my music as it helps me too 💯
"Hi I'm new here. Just wanted to reach out.
Have anxiety and ATM it's really high.
Feel like I'm having a heart attack sometimes.
I go for walks get fresh air, even bought some brain vitamins to calm me down.
Struggle to make friends just feel lonely",Hi Tracey. Welcome to the group. I used to struggle massively with anxiety but loads better now. Do you know why you’re anxious? Are you undergoing any forms of therapy? Happy to PM if you’d prefer. Sounds similar to how I used to feel so can sympathise to a degree. Well done for reaching out! 🖤,I find listening to white noise calms me
"I just found the group today. I am dealing with PTSD, depression, anxiety and the accompanying mood swings. I was in a pedestrian accident involving a snow plow in January 2004 and in July 2012 I witnessed my Aunt who was also my housemate pass away in our bathroom from ruptured scar tissue in her lungs caused by radiation treatment for her lung cancer. I went untreated for a number of years which only led to my condition getting progressively worse. I am currently in counseling and looking for a therapy group to join. I have also been researching some things I can do on my own to manage my condition. I look forward to sharing my journey with all of you.",Thank you for your story. Have you tried medication?,I fought my anxiety and PTSD through the help of Gabriel_tripper on Instagram after suffering from it for 15 years. He's highly recommended! Now my whole life feels new again.
The past 5 weeks I'm having really bad sleep anxiety and panic attacks. Every time I drift off I wake up in a panic within minutes and have to jump out of bed. It feels like I can't breathe and I have to go outside for air. I'm so exhausted from lack of sleep. 😢,This happened to me after a traumatic event in 1990. Doctor gave me medication with nasty side effects so i gave it up. I felt just like you. I had migraine I.b.s. As soon as I closed my eyes I started having nightmares. I think it was p.t.s.d. In 1994 I tried medication again and am still on it now. The secret was to start on a lower dose and build up slowly. Before going on medication I was often bed bound but symptoms did start to subside. I also have m.e.,I get the same panik attacks anxiety I suffer from bipolar disorder I've been struggling lots with my mental health and I have to search for a flat as I live in a temporary accommodation and that gives me even more anxiety and I get very stressed and I even don't have a support worker or a care coordinator I'm struggling lots since I came out the hospital last summer on section 3
How do I stop repeating a song in my head 🙏,"So, I constantly have every song Ive ever listened to in my head at all times. The dopamine then picks a song to blurt out in any situation Im in. I put my headphones on and listen to music which helps a little, but obviously you cant wear headphones 24/7 so if anyone else has any good answers then I would also like to know. Though I think Im a lost cause 😅","I get this at times, it's just anxiety, I usually distract myself, it will go away."

"I thought I had worked through my childhood trauma, but now I’m in a relationship and I overthink EVERYTHING and when we have disagreements I automatically think the worst outcome… (Our relationship is healthy but my thoughts are not.. It’s so draining…)",I have the same issue.  In my latest relationship I over think every little thing and need so much reassurance that we are ok.

"I just started on sertraline two days ago. I know the side effects are temporary but I have never been so low and it's so hard to keep going. Dreaming about not being here anymore. Spacing out. Not showing interest in anything. Loss of appetite. Feeling sick. Shooting pains through my head. Feeling completely out of it, spacing out and feeling so sleepy. Please tell me this passes soon 🥺 I need to be ok again","These got me through university.   It takes about three weeks if you still feeling depressed you need a medicine review. Maybe higher dose.  

If other people notice your personality changing make an emergency appointment.","I had bad side affects but I knew I had to just persevere bcoz I wanted to feel better, so 2 months later they worked but after a few years on them I needed to up the mg as your body gets used to them, so that's what my gp did, they're working great now"
Has anyone done a direct switch from sertraline to citolpram? I swapped because I started getting anxiety again but the sertraline has been way worse for me so I'm back on citolpram first dose today. Will it be like the first swap in terms of symptom? It's been 8 weeks. Thanks,I have been on both worked for a little while now on fluexotine,"I had comparative involvement in my better half even with every one of the signs I stood up to him yet he lied about the undertaking, somebody really conversed with me about eric_cyberhacker who could connect his telephone somewhat direct to mine without him knowing or contacting his telephone before I had the option to get proof from his talk and instant messages even erased discussions straightforwardly to my telephone.

I am planning #walkandtalkcampaign2021 and I'd hope that many of you will come along either  for some of the walk or its entirety. You have plenty of time to plan and train. 😉

Although 2020 has been a damp squib for a lot of people. My heart goes out to those that have been personally effected by coronavirus. My heart goes out to you and your family.

Let's keep hope that 2021 will be a year to remember. My wish is for mental health to be sufficiently funded and the right resources are available.

Love to you all. Keep safe. Keep well. Keep talking! ❤","I would like to do some off the walk please , live in east Preston, Steve ",I had my cold shower lasted longer today watched my breathing about 6 mins🥳🤣☕️🍰
Does anyone else finds this if you known someone for years or someone you get to know and they know that you suffer with mental health if you mention your having a bad time they back away or go silent which makes you feel even worse,That just happened to me....put me lower than I'd ever felt....I'm so grateful my daughter noticed something wrong and persuaded me to therapy,"I had that happen to me, now I just cry in silence. I don't have any friends , as they don't know how to comfort me."
"My partner has been sectioned recently. And when I was at his property getting him basic bits. When looking for a bag to put it all in, I found a bra hidden in his kitchen in a cupboard behind a door under some bags along with a ‘tie’ thing that goes round a dress or something. 

I understand his situation and have been so patient and still tried to help, but now my brain is on complete over drive about it? I don’t know whether to just ask him about it or leave it. My MH is bad anyway, and this is really affecting me 🤯🤯🤯","My advice is to stay supportive, it's easy to be divided so these things can be discussed later when in a better place.  Its strength to be together in tough times. You've got this .",I had to ask for my own sanity and as I thought he’d kick off and deny everything but I don’t know 😟

I am new in the group.
I want to know how many friends do you have that you completely trust.
If you are someone who doesn't have anyone then let's connect
thank you",Are you male or female?,I have 4 friends I would trust with my life and a few others that are friends but I haven't known them as long l(it takes me a very long time to trust someone).

Trust in your prayers",I have a hormonal condition as well as my damaged brain 😭. But I am back from the dead 😁
"Hi guys, this is the first time I'll ever share my real feelings with nyone, so please forgive me if I cross boundaries.

At this point, I feel I should accept that I'll have low self esteem for the rest of my life. I'll never be able to fix it.

I cant afford therapy. And im worried that the low cost or free therapist won't be able to help me with my issues. Plus, I'm scared od being open and vulnerable with them. It's like I'm giving them do much power over me. Control. They can do anything to me. Abd they might even abuse their power by gaslightjng me. I feel like some have god complexes.

I feel like im in prison. Every day. Serving life.

Sometimes, I wish I was a narcissist or sociopath. I can't take this anymore. I have a lot of anger, cynicism and low self esteem. I would rather let myself be killed by someone. Which I pray for every night. When I look in the mirror, I feel like vomiting. My face repulsed me.

I like hurting myself emotionally. I find it fun in a way.. It makes me feel a little tingly. I love insulting and destroying my self esteem. I love hurting. I know, it sounds bad, but I can't help it.

I regret the day I even touched john bradshaws homecoming. What was i thinking? Trying to fix my trauma. I should've just stayed in my lie. I wish I could pretend that my life was perfect, regardless of how my family used me. I'm a fool. I never should've opened that book. 

I was a fool. Such a fool. I knew deep down this was hopeless.

Who was I to think that there would actually be people who cared about me. I'll never fins someone who cares about me genuinely. I mean, I've never had friends or romantic relationships in my 21 years on this planet.
I have no one in my life. I've never had anyone to care about.

I've come to realize something. Even though my mom is narcissistic, she really is the only person in the world who actually cares about me. I mean, there's no one else I the world who will love me like she did. She's the only person who genuinely cares about me. No one will ever love me. Even if I was a tool, at least she notices that I exist. She was there when the rest of society rejected me.",Google crisis centers in your area.

There's nothing else you can do about it. As time moves forward, away from this point, the pain will ease. It won't disappear but you learn to live with it.

"If anyone on here is from the UK, do you have any advice on how to get a CAMHS appointment quicker? I’ve been on the waiting list for a year and my mental health is just deteriorating and I need to be seen","Not sure either are of any help to you. 

Check out mind they have an advocate service, not sure they might be able to help? I'd double check some of the other young people services also. They may be able to advocate to help?

Also there is a thing called right to choose, when if you have been reffered you have a right to choose a dr / service. Might be worth googling, sometime they used to be able to refer you to other services / (including pvt)  hopefully have shorter waiting lists. 

Really hope 1 of them helps in someway. Stay strong. x","I have been on the list with 2 children now for well over a year for the assessment’s to begin etc the waiting list to be seen is well over 2 yrs unless you go through health insurance you just gotta wait it out, there is so much mental health being brought to light without the nhs having resources to cope right now but best thing to do is try to find coping mechanisms and to become a lot more self aware and help yourself last thing you want is just to be put on pills and expect them to fix you , all that will do is mask it all so you show little symptoms it won’t actually do much other than make you a zombie that complies with everything. It’s hard to help yourself and learn about how best to cope but you can manage it while you wait and go to the appointment armed with loads to back up you reasons for the assessment use you time wisely while you wait I record my seizures and all sorts I record meltdowns from the kids etc it all helps them to see day to day living not just assess you in 10 mins with no evidence xx hope you get seen sooner xx"

"Urgent help please - please take the time to read ☹️

Hi I’m new here and posting anonymously due to not wanting people to know about my mental health. I need some advice from anyone who has experience psychosis or schizophrenia. 

I have BPD and it has been diagnosed for 4-5 years. I used to be on an anti-psychotic called Quetiapine and also an anti depressant Sertraline but I came off these about a year ago. 

Basically, I’ve been really paranoid about things due to my trust being broken by a lot of people, childhood trauma ect I probably have PTSD!! 

An incident happened on Friday where I basically worked myself up over absolutely nothing but I believed everything my head was telling me. I then started to feel really weird and thought I had hyper ventilated which caused mt to go light headed but I realised I wasn’t breathing any faster and mt heart was a normal pace. I wasn’t having a panic attack either. 

I started pacing and shaking my hands saying “I’m not here, I don’t feel like I’m here”. I felt like I wasn’t in control of my body. I couldn’t hear any back ground noises like the cars driving past or the telling, I literally felt like I was in the back of my head and couldn’t feel my body. 

Then I tried to force myself to sleep to which I found my eyes didn’t want to shut and we’re doing their own thing like looking around and then I started to not just think I saw a dark figure but I FELT a dark figure stood behind my in the door way. I also kept hearing noises. 

My head continued to feel like it wasn’t even on my shoulders. I kept saying to my friend “I don’t feel like I’m here I’m scared”. I kept turning the light on because I felt like my eyes every now and again would “black out” when they shut for a quick second. It’s really hard to explain. 

I realised I had probably severely dissociated to the point I couldn’t “come back” and it really scared me. My head was bringing up random things and talking and I’d believe it all and the thought would lead to a next thought and the next and so on. In about 10 seconds I’d probably had 100+ thoughts just leading on and on from each other. 

I eventually forced myself to sleep at 4am because I was exhausted. I woke up an hour later with my head still feeling the same like I wasn’t here at all. 

I was secretly confused at was reality and what was my head thinking of scenarios or even dreaming. I didn’t know if what I was feeling or thinking was rea which was also really scary. Again, I want to mention my eyes were literaly doing their own thing! 

I then woke up in the morning better but still not completely with it. I forced an anti psychotic down myself and just slept till I felt better. 

I know with BPD some of this is normal and so are seeing dark shadows when off medication but I generally believed in my own head and body that I FELT someone stood in the door way. I must of looked crazy constantly twitching from under the quilt to look and see who was there. 

But I really want is someone to tell me what happened to me. Im worried I may of had like an episode of psychosis or if I maybe have schizophrenia I just don’t know. Someone please help 😩 

Im re referring myself to the mental health access hub this morning because IAPT say my case is too complex and the secondary mental health team say im too mentally unstable for seeing a psychologist. Im sorry but it’s quite obvious I need help because im getting worse. 

Any help or advice appreciate 🙏🏼🙏🏼",Were  you off your medication if yes that’s probably the reason why you went through all that horrible things you saw and heard  I hope you are going to a psychiatric hospital to get back on your medication I heard some people when they start to feel better on medication feel they don’t need it anymore then they get off of it an th symptoms start all over again get well listen to doctors nurses and social workers and stay on your medication,I have severe unstable personality disorder with a psychosis. I do take an anti psychotic and tablets for extreme anxiety and depression. I also get how you have gotten I'm awake but can never remember a thing that happens . Sometimes I'm ok and come around easily but others I'm so bad that my partner gets really scared  I've never hurt anyone I always hurt myself and its been seriously bad. I would keep some kind of diary if you can  I don't understand why you are not seeing a psychologist  I have one and I have to see them every 3 months because of the severity. They have determined that I will never get better and I have to try to live and cope the best way I can with mine . Please push to be referred to a mental health specialist because you really don't want things to escalate. I'm here to talk if you have questions x
"Am so stressed right now 
I can’t function 
am practically paralysed 
I have bipolar and acute anxiety disorder, does anyone else feel like this?",I have chronic depression with fits of anger doesn't take much to set me off,I have the same thing about three weeks ago I went downhill the thoughts were louder the anxiety was sky high my feelings were all over the place so at the suggestion of  my therapist I am going to an outpatient program three days a week the hours a days I saw my psychiatrist the other day I was finally able to let him know how I feel by giving him a list if there is a program like the one I am going to check it out if not get with your therapist
"idk why i SOMETIMES text some people too much, but i’m assuming it’s because of depression and/or major depressive disorder 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
i used to get bored a lot, at home or at my cousin’s house. for example, i have a big age gap with my cousins and i’m at their hous sitting on the sofa, and i am all of a sudden bored and don’t know what to do, to entertain myself bc they’re busy with things. but now, i don’t get bored that often like before, which is probably good 

does anyone know why or have any ideas why i sometimes text some people too much? is it bc of an attachment disorder or something? (just taking a guess about the reason)",Because you feal alone darling and maybe you don't want other people to feal that way so you text them and theirs no harm in that I'd rather have someone text me 100 times a day showing me they care rather than not at all,"I have this too 
And in my case its because of rough childhood.
I'm the only child 
Was not liked in primary school... Man that was tough. The were bullying me verbally and I was bullying them physically ... But it was always me against THEM. 
I was alone most of the time. 
So that's the reason for my behavior (which i learned to control with years... To some extent)"
"I’m not sure about anyone else but I feel overwhelmed and have become so passive. This is not how I normally am. Honestly wondering why I’m still around. The answer I come up with is other people need me in their lives. It just doesn’t feel right, like I get used up and I have no energy or motivation to do anything for myself. I ask myself, is this all there is?!?!","Put yourself first, before others. Invest in yourself before you can expect to be there for others. I learned this the hard way. Everything else won't matter if you can't be in the right place mentally. It'll eventually break you, unexpectedly. I changed the way I thought and do things. I come first. It's selfish, yeah, but it's what's best for me. And it could be what's best for you, since you can put in the work to make sure you are in the best version of you, so you can offer that person to others.","I have to say, I seriously thought about it and decided I HAVE to come first when it comes to care. I also made an appointment with my dr and we discovered a side effect of one of my meds was breaking down my muscles. Took me off it and with the kind words from people here, I’m feeling so much better! Thank you all for taking the time out of your day to help a stranger. I truly appreciate it!"
It hurts my heart so much that my partner is relapsing and not one person will help her what will it take for some one to listen and help,"It's your partner, if no one else will help, then you need to step up and manage the situation, if they need medical attention get them to a hospital or call an ambulance, that should be obvious! Call her family, but most importantly look after her!, get off Facebook and focus on her and her alone!","I have to speak out past 3 years for my peace of mind but know l am nearing breaking point 🙏 & my health is suffering big time.
My hubby is mentally ill but will not address it & he takes it out on me. It is full blown mental abuse & very complicated. We have known each other 50 yrs , married 42.
So sad & heartbreaking."
"At the lowest
Lost my job and forced to retirement, lost my car my mental health is deteriorating rapidly ..fits of anger 
 Constantly feeling numb","I cannot get any benefits either because I rent out a second home I invested in during my work service and the rent covers the mortgage so I’m
Financially crippled",I hope 2024 is a better year for you 🥰 keep strong

"Hi, I'm a Mother of an adult 36 yr old male who is in full blown Psychosis and has been for 2 months and is  getting worse. He has been hospitalized twice in the last month, but refused to take any medication,  so both facilities released him. They said he was not threatening to hurt himself or others, even though they are fully aware he is in a manic Psychosis.  Last night he was out on my front porch  and then very calmly came into the kitchen where I was and announced that the executioner has a new rule. Anyone that does not agree with his line of thinking will be killed with a blow right between their eyes with his fist. Trust me, he could do it, he's naturally strong. I had him repeat it so that I could put it on audio on my phone. I live in Indiana. Would that be considered a threat? Enough to call the police? Please help",The police can put him under section and get him a mental health assessment if they decide that's appropriate,"I hope you are feeling better julie, my prayers are for wellbeing of you and your son.

"Ugh… must escape this void dark thoughts are consuming me I’m tired of them I get it on Saturday was hard which set back unwanted feelings but I’m ready to let go but I can’t stop being anxious 

I can’t even sleep either 

My time is messed up 

I’m on my period 

I’m just a mess 

I can’t stop thinking of unwanted thoughts 

I eventually get out of this funk but I fake till I make it each time 

I’m just so drained

Can someone talk to me to lift my spirits? I usually don’t ask people to talk on 1 on 1 but this time I need it",I'm here if you want to talk I know it's really gsrd when feerling that way please looom at the positives of how far you have come and how determined you are to keep improving big hugs!!!,I hope you are getting some professional support. Glad to turned to this site and I hope you get some support here too. How to cheer up a person who is down? Empathise. Been there but always found a way out. So hard. Life is full of ups and downs. As sure as you are down something will lift you up. You must be a lovely person. I hope good things come your way. When the sun shines smell the flowers watch the butterflys. What is making you sad?

"When you feel very disturbed how do you rant? 

Do you draw something scary/odd? 

Or go into writing dark stuff? Or what do you do? 

I found myself drawing very terrifying things and um okay this may seem silly but I roleplay with Ai apps for fun and therapy I created my own original charaxter( which I gotta draw later) and I have the most traumatic and triggering backstory for her and in a way it helps so much whenever I feel anger or I feel my possible BPD kick in 

It’s like venting in a form feels so nice 

I only posted this because I wanna see what you fellas do and um what more hobbies I can add into self therapy  

So suggest me stuff if ya can thanks. 💙","I think it depends if it's a natural thought of a thing that happens, or if you go looking for the dark things. 
I write sometimes - short stories, poems, training and coaching things and even websites. 
But sometimes when I start free writing the most dark things come out. Murder, sex, violence. 
But that's ok cos it is offset with all the nice things I write and do. 
But if I was to start each session by asking myself what dark thing can I write today - well that makes it a more conscious form of darkness, more real. Whereas, when it does come out of me, it's the subconscious, it's like a purge of thoughts, experiences, the world news etc.",I just go for long walks

It would help relieve some of the stress.","PTSD, Anxiety, complex trauma, and depression has been impairing a lot of people around the world and researchers have proven that mind manifestation (microdosing) has been of great help to us, I was struggling for years but now I'm more creative and productive.

My dad n mum separated my boyfriend left me I lost my baby thru miscarriage I lost my sister the same year that's last year I basically need support,Jackline Calicstàr I am sorry to hear you feel that but I am glad you felt comfortable sharing. Feel free to share more or to reach out in case you need someone to listen to you,"I know all that would be alot to take onboard.  You need to separate whats your problems and whats theirs. Dont take onboard their problems as this will relieve some of the stress.  It will minimise what you can deal with.  

It would be good for you to recognise your baby by giving the baby a name.   That way youve named your baby even with a miscarriage.   There are many options to place a memorial, a plant eg rose in the garden that you can visit.  Also alot of hospitals have a grief and loss counsellor.   You could also do the same for your sister."
"My partner of 3 years has said to me she can not see a purpose in being with me. Yes, I have an Anxiety disorder among other issues..

But it is up to you what you can do.,I know exactly how you feel I was in 3 year realtionship and found it was a lie and broke it off it best thing I ever done as the mental torture they out me through was worse ever I never do it to my worst enemy let alone someone they meant to love x
What I hate people who say that they are friends but just after 5 minutes they don't want to know me,"What I have witnessed is people are around to be your friends - unfortunately some just care handle situations of mental health and for there of mental health have to break away.

It’s extremely difficult and frustrating for those who really need friends, unfortunately unless we discuss mental health openly people will never be able to understand and support fully. 

I’m sorry you are in a dark place at the moment - things will turn around and I pray one day soon you find a supportive friend who understands you x",I know how that goes
Hi thank you for letting me join. Was just wondering anyone one else stick in a job that they hate to the dtage I want to end it all,If you don’t like your job why are you still there your only resenting it more each day are you interested in anything you would like to do you deserve more,I know how u feel as one time I thought that I had a friend but she was not like her dear late mother at all
"I'm not looking forward to Christmas. All I want to do is spend the day in bed.
I have a 7 year old daughter, so I have to put on a brave face.",It sounds like you are exhausted. Is there anyone who can look after your little girl before the big day so that you can have a day in bed. It was my psychiatrist who asked me to look at depression as a lack of vitality. The first thing I did was work on my energy levels.,I know how you feel hun i don't have family apart from my daughter but both of us don't do Christmas anymore for me it's a really bad time bcus of my anxiety really plays up this time of year and tbh i can't wait for it to be over.

"I’d just like to go to bed, comfy and warm and never wake up. It’d be such a blessing. No drama, no violence, just gone.","My  husband used to use my trauma to manipulate me and control me. I used to end up using these sentences because literally all we did was fight and it was so frustrating. For example, whenever we used to argue, if it didn't go his way, he would threaten to leave me. Initially it worked and hed start packing his bags, sending me into a tailspin (hello, abandonment issues). Eventually he did this so often that i would literally roll my eyes and be like ""ok, here we go again"", Eventually he realized that this didn't work. I definitely grey rocked him without even knowing what it was. I would accuse him so often of cheating, but he would conclude that it was me going ""you're imagining things""
""you have issues""you're upset over nothing"".
I was referred to a software expert who helped me clone his phone and laptop from where i got evidence of his cheating and all I did was send his phone number to the tech and through a remote link sent to my email, I was Able to Access all of his texts, emails, Facebook and Instagram chat, realtime call listening and his long deleted messages as if the phone was physically with me so I plan to seek for a divorce really soon.

Having a bad time a the moment. Lost my job back in August. Then a month later my partner left after 20 years. Also just in the last couple of weeks. We had two deaths in the family a week apart. Struggling to find help not really a social person so support Is limited to my son. Any advice thanks,Sorry to hear. I on the other hand have never worked ever before so have not had that experience and I have never had a partner leave me before or have never left them which there have not been many to tell the truth. I have gone through grief which is difficult but it is a normal part of life it happens to us all. I lost my late mother and my late fiancée recently. I have two children a heir and a spare but they are no longer with me and in another persons care. We all have our problems they just differ from one to the other. Even I am looking for help and advice but when you look around you do not see it. You never find it.

I just don't get why things are consistently so difficult why we let our supposed I guess you can say leaders considering our society is based on having someone else control our lives so yeah leaders...they all SUCK and we all get to suffer yeppie what a fabulous life we all have.  Okay I'm gonna stop now because I won't if I keep going.  Anyways big hugs Blessed Be to you all!","Totally get the concept and I Don't believe it's  crazy. Tbh I've started to feel that many struggling with their mental health are in search of logic and made to feel they don't fit, I also believe heavy medication supports a dumbing down. I mean no disrespect my friend and I discussed meds and mental health a lot last year  and her words they help numb her , I'm a thinker and the last thing society on a whole needs is to be numb. So push through my friend. I do believe there is help out there, its just not a priority of those in charge.","I once believed that my beloved spouse was the epitome of perfection.

"I am watching morning live, and they are saying that if you have a medical problem, don’t just ring up the Surgery as a first default, try and contact your pharmacy or pop into a chemist and see if they can help, and if they can’t, they will refer you to a doctor.

It’s almost impossible to get a doctor’s appointment now, so the pharmacy may be the next best thing if not better.",See it to believe it!,"I once tried to get in touch with my local chemist about a repeat prescription.

This would be the first time I post or share with anyone. I had a good life made sure people go to right path  but the same people blocked the path for me. I'm a trade worker and have done way more jobs with good money.  I'm 36 years old and I feel like it will end there   not my thought it's people who pushes.

"I love this question. If you could be anything, I mean anything. What would you be? Remember, what you say tells me alot about you. 😉 Comment below 👇","Somehow educate people about how to have a productive discussions with others, especially with those who have different views and opinions. This is especially important now we can speak to anyone about anything, online, without knowing or seeing the person you are talking to. 
If only people knew how beneficial it is for themselves and everyone else. I'm sure they would do it. 
I'm not influential enough to make much of a difference but if I was, that's what I would be advocating.
Sometimes even a question, or questions, that are asked of peiple or groups of people, have insult or bigotry or dehumanization woven into the very asking.

People often feel really frustrated by the beliefs, views and opinions ions  of others and feel that they have to ""correct"" them, and in doing so they can come across as condescending, patronising and aggressive. And not always accidentally!   
 Its a shame that much online debating/discussing seems to have descended into the kind of arguments you might hear in a school playground: ""You're stupid"", ""No, you're stupid for calling me stupid"".
We would all do well to remember that there are myriad social, economic, cultural and educational factors that determine what and how people think. 
It's important to understand each other and to talk with and listen to what others say. There's room enough for all of our views and discussion with a view to understanding oeopkes mindset (not the same as agreeing) is how we manage to find the best answers to issues that affect us all in different ways.  
nothing changes without  that and it's important not only to let others know what WE think but to understand how OTHERS think. No one person has all rhe answers to problems that exist and divide society.  
So by all means people should certainly carry on talking about their opinions/views and beliefs, and challenging other people about theirs but I would encourage  thinking the what it is they are trying to achieve. If its to he taken seriously, be heard or help solve the big issues of the time, its not just about telling people what you think and dismissing what others think as if has no worth. This has no positive impact on anyone including the individual trying to get their message across. 
We are all aware that how we say things is often as important, if not more so, than what we say. So in order to utilise the resources we bow have to talk to each other, it would be great if we all knew how to make the most and get the best out of it. 
Maybe schools could teach young people about how to do this since so much of our modern day lives are conducted via the internet. It seems odd that people are unaware of how and why they should use it correctly, especially when researching information and interacting with others on social media.
Sorry for the overly long answer. That's something I'm working on! Lol.",I personally would be a really soft rug but a really cheap one so the needle is probably still there somewhere

Depression is taking over I drink so much it doesn’t effect me anymore can I beat this . The other way is looking better and better.,My partner was the same. He was drinking wine every single day and nothing made him stop.

He would not stop until it made him sick and even then he would abstain for a little while but would always return back. It was changing his mood and changing his character.,I prayed about my drinking I've Been clean for over 17 years 💯💯🙏

"Hello all, looking for advice. I’m 29, I’ve been in a relationship for 6 years but it’s just come to an end. It was her decision. Long story short I became friends with a lady but as I’m a guy she says I can’t be trusted as she knows what men are like. She is friends with loads of men but I have to accept it?
I am really struggling with the disconnect. 
She tells me if she could flick a switch and make everything okay again she would, she tells me that she still loves me but is enjoying her life more now she is out of the relationship. 
I am clinging onto the little hope that one day she will turn around and give me another chance but I am hurting so much in the process.

It’s just like grief as you’ve lost someone you care deeply about

No gruesome details but not thought it would never pass and I’d be forever low and blue
But it did
I can’t say exactly when in my grieving process it just happened slowly and done days i felt like you do now (a week is v short to get over this😊)
But as I say in time and making a new life for just me it faded
Not saying it disappeared but the pain got less and I was able to move on
My suggestion is grieve cry shout get drunk if that’s your thing - but between that find something new to do. 
Something you’d never done together
Might be a small thing like adult colouring but find something you like to do
Small steps wirk best from my own experience
Not sure that’s ever so helpful but I know you can get through this and eventually you might go back to being good friends given time and space and patience

"In the last 24 hours, ive had to take a proper and deep look inside myself to identify a trigger and a reason for the behaviour that comes with the trigger.

Ive realised that I have quite severe rejection sensitivity. I know its because I was physically and mentally abused and emotionally neglected when I was a child.. I know that.
But how do I stop this? How do I stop feeling like this? How do I train my emotional brain to stop seeing rejection in everyone's behaviour towards me? How do I train my emotional brain to believe in myself? To believe that I am actually loved? How do I stop seeing certain behaviours as rejection, and just see things as they are? How do I stop trying to reject people because I believe they will reject me first?

No matter what I try to do to change my life everything is a total disaster in my opinion, being born is my biggest problem I’m finding each Christmas more and more difficult being I really have no one for support all I have are the memories of abuse from my uncle, my father and grandmother calling me stupid over and over again and constantly being bullied into almost everything I’m seriously considering suicide because there is clearly nothing else left in life no matter what I do",I understand.

"How do you handle anxiety and overthinking
Ive been dealing with this for the past few months my realtionship is gettaffected",I found writing things down really helps.,I try to stay focused on the present and not think too far into the future. When I really need to ground myself I've taken up meditation. It focuses my thoughts on what is important. I realized looking to far ahead was a trigger for me because I can't control the future only the present. One of my issues is the need for control and I can't control everything.

"Hi all. Been on a bit of a journey. Feeling much better now.
I wanted to share my recovery and if poss ,help those who are struggling with mental health as I have. Sharing is one of the most powerfull ways to recover from anxiety or depression as far as I know(hepled me massively)",How did it help ? I've tried explaining it to my teenager and my 20 yr daughter and they still don't understand why I act the way I do at times. I have major depressive disorder and anxiety,"I turned 53 today and am in the same boat.  Been in psychotherapy and on medicinal marijuana for a year and I'm finally at peace

"Hi 
I would introduce myself but really i want to be anonymous in this case. 
I'm male around 25 year old. 
I've suffered from depression some years ago and sometimes (like today) it comes back. Each time is more manageable but it's getting hard. From original depression it was harder and harder for me to cry... I was not suppressing it, it just went that way. Today is the first time when I realized that I'm not able to cry. I want ... But i can not. 

To be precised I will NOT hurt myself and don't take my words like that. Life is just getting shittier every year for me. Multiple work life failures, only one true relationship where I loved my partner and lots of mining less shit since the brake up years ago.

Just wanted to share this with you guys 
Maybe someone will understand what I am going through.","Depression is hard, it is like a slow draining of your life.
Please go to youtube and listen to this talk.

I hope it helps you, as it helped me.",I understand... I'm 27 and go through the same thing. Can never control when it comes and goes but it's just something I find I have to let take it's course until it passes. It's definitely getting harder as the years go on though and the numb feeling that comes with it stays for longer.

Has anyone heard of disability transferation? Where someone’s disability can transfer onto another being without the condition. Let me know in the comments below? :),Yes.

How do you know if you’re being discriminated against because of your mental health? I know that sounds silly and I’m sorry if it is but I really feel as though I’m being discriminated against by the council as they’re saying my mental health is not ‘bad enough’ when they’re given the evidence they’ve asked for in the first place.

"I’ve suffered for 12 years and never received a diagnosis. Just get illnesses written down with a question mark next to them on my medical records 🤦🏼‍♀️ not helpful as I need to know how to manage it!
My symptoms are: 
- every now and then (could be monthly or every couple of months) get very depressed, cannot cope and need looking after by my partner/ or mum, but when they come home to look after me I quickly become very positive (as if them being there is all I needed) 
- I can get highs but they don’t last long at all, changes very quickly, where I feel ‘buzzing’ and just want sex, I’d literally have sex with anyone at that point 
- I’m impulsive with spending, won’t spend on things I need or bills etc but just on things that give me a temporary buzz 
- I have severe anxiety, always think something bad will happen, or someone will hurt me 
- I have severe mood swings, I can tell my partner I’m going to leave him and will tell family how much I hate him, but then minutes later love him so much and he’s the best thing in the world… 

Does this sound like anyone else? Any idea what it is? As they’ve questioned bipolar, then borderline personality disorder, but I’ve never received a diagnosis and I’ve been referred to the mental health team a few times but they decline the referral as I don’t harm myself or others",Have you seen a psychiatrist?,"I would be shocked if not bipolar they have a duty of care you are a risk to yourself when you have these episodes , you deserve to be looked after and have proper care plans xx"
Bit of stupid  question  but not sure who arsk and I lost my paper work to covid test is 2 lines positive fill like rubbish  do people  still need to isolate still I got my daughter  son coming  tomorrow  be greatful  for for ur help and merry Christmas  🎅 🎄 xx,If you have COVID you don't share it if you can,I would call your local pharmacy pharmacy
What do I do my friend is stealing from our boss iam torn between my friend and keeping  my job,I am probably going to be in the minority. But all i would do is just mention to the friend that i know what they are doing and that in the end the boss could realise. Im not going to tell the boss. But that they arent doing themselves any favours for the future when they get caught.,I would chat to your friend and say u don't bite the hand that feeds u.  I could never still from my boss or anyone. I rather give and steal
"This might be a long shot but does anyone know of any FREE talking therapies I can use via email or text that will check in every now and then?

"Hi everybody. Thank you for adding me to this site.
I have been suffering with serious depression and severe anxiety and was also diagnosed with anti social personality disorder. I lost my dad to dementia last year Novembef after I moved home years before to help mom look after him, then in early 2020. Unfortunately I got Covid which gave me water on the organs, liver, kidney problems, clot on thd lung and heart failure, so that stopped me helping as much as I could. I look and care for mom now and just lost my close Uncle two days ago who was my dads elder brother.
Everyday has been a struggle as you all know it takes 100% effort anyway but now mom has give up, I have no support or friends but been used by many which has cost me mentally and money wise. I feel that I have a sign on my head saying help yourself and make fun, call me names like fat git and alot worse, it must say use me!
I am known as the moaner, so can't win
53 and from 15 battling and tried CBT, every theropy going. Had a psychologist and psy chiatrist for over 20 years. Now on my own, caring for mom with no future. So now just gave up. I have tried but I get the above attitude.
There is no answer.","There's online courses you could go for, online groups you could join, groups on Facebook you could join, see if there's a coffee group in your area, a walking group, etc",I would love a group round this area but there are not any and I have to be at the call of my mom and others for some reason or my life becomes hell.
"What do you do when you feel like you can't get close to anyone because they will leave (or die) ? 

What to do when it's been going on as far back as you can remember?","You learn to get comfortable with being alone, you open the door occasionally to let someone in, but you always expect they will go out too.
You also remember that if the company of someone gives you pleasure, the loss of that person is the price you pay for the pleasure.
There is no pleasure without pain","I would seek out a therapist.  Life is too short to worry about the “what ifs” and yes, people do pass but we still live our lives."

"I've just accepted a new job and the same day I found out I'm 5 weeks pregnant. My partner is over the moon ecstatic, however I'm just miserable. Its really not the time. Mentally I dont think I can cope with this, I'm currently in crisis management and waiting on a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. I cant go through with an abortion as was in a bad situation years ago that has given me PTSD. I'm just feeling trapped, overwhelmed and honestly I'm just feeling so guilty for feeling this way. Most people would be ecstatic but for myself I just feel like each blow is another nail in the coffin for my mental health. I just dont know what to do. My partner thinks I'll just stop feeling like this and be excited soon I just cant see that happening at the moment",You need to talk to people about it. Get support. You can work and have a baby. How old are you?,I would suggest to speak to a counselling service that specialise with pregnancy support.
"Hi I'm hoping for some advice if possible?

I've been in and out of therapy/meds for around 12 years now and was out of therapy/meds for 4ish years but feel like I've took a drastic dive.

I've called up my local talking therapies which referred me onto a community team which did an assessment and they basically come out with borderline personality disorder which has something that's been back and forth over years along with bi-polar (however bi-polar was ruled out) but in the end it's always been put down to depression and anxiety 

They've now referred me to enhanced psychological therapies and I need an initial assessment to see if they will be able to meet my needs ect and possible looking into another assessment. 

Sorry for the long post put is anyone been through something similar and give me an idea of what I can expect?

I keep thinking what if I'm just wasting their time and someone else might need it more thatln me? Anxiety is through the roof and was hoping to see if anyone knew what to expect?

Sorry if not allowed- and thanks for any advice you may be able to give 🩷",i am bipolar and only doctors can diagnose u im also border line personality u dont need to worry about other patients worry about ur own health u need to be there for a reason and start taking ur meds,"I'll recommend you reach out to  recharld.trppy on Instagram he will be of much help to you.

"I’m probably going to get reported again from another person in the group or kicked out by the admins for expressing my pain. But I’m going to say it anyways. When someone is at their low and can’t see a way out, people automatically think that if they end up making a rope necklace they are weak. If they take a handful of vitamins they just gave up. But the on looker doesn’t realize that it takes more strength to run and fall with scissors than to suffer with the pain. I’ve been living 30yrs with my suffering. Being told the worst things you could tell a person. Treated like I don’t matter. And yes, I understand that some people have had it a lot worse than me and don’t compare myself to them. People have different traumas but we all needed help. So what I’m saying is that, when someone says they’re having a bad day ask them how YOU can help. Sometimes a hug will help more than you know.","Big hugs from Malta , Europe . Xx","I'm also tired of people using ""it could be worse"" as some point being made.
Your brain constantly pushing for you to end ""it"" is the worst your brain can do to you.
They don't truly understand at all. Unless they have ever been that tortured."
What I hate most is when I start to feel ok being alone that's when people want me in their lives and then it puts me in grief again and I lose feeling ok to be alone and start grieving when they drop me like I don't matter all over again.,Same.

"Hi everybody, relatively new to the group. First of all, I admire everybody for coming here and opening up and seeking help. It takes great strength and courage to do that so well done everybody. Today, I’ve been really down, I’ve had some horrible thoughts, to the point where I even called Samaritans and I spoke to the most amazing woman, who  during that phone call, made me feel invincible. But now I’m sat here in the dark, going through the motions again. I’m medicated with sertraline (100mg) and mertazapine. My family don’t understand why I feel like I just wanna not be here, I don’t Understand it either. I am surrounded by a loving family and I have a job that I’m quite proud of and do enjoy. Just this last week or so, I just want to give up, my safe space has become my bed, I’m sleeping to escape reality. I don’t know what else to do. This is my first post here and I’m sorry it’s anonymous. I just feel deeply ashamed.","Don't feel ashamed. 
You are amazing and stay strong.","I'm glad you came and expressed how you are feeling.  I too phone the Samaritans and it helps having that person to person contact.  Then I make a list and do one thing then another to get through the day, get things done and keep me out of bed.  Then I feel better that I survived another day.  The bad feeling eventually go away and life becomes manageable again.  Hope you can find your way through each day and feel better soon."
"😶‍🌫️I get so depressed😞 and get severe anxiety 😬because I'm always 😴.

It's definitely important to have faith and a positive thinking about your future. Sometimes we just need to rewire our thought patterns to change our perspective on life and our reality.

This fear has caused me to avoid social situations, even with my own relatives. I have been doing this for five years, and now people may be thinking that I am either mad, crazy, or too shy. I am not sure what to do to address this situation.""",I learnt a while back now how irrelevant others thoughts are. If you're not judging others all the time they're probably not either.

"Hello everyone.  Hope you are all doing well. Is anyone interested in talking?. I haven't had my antidepressants in a few day's because I'm having a difficult time finding a walk in doctor.  Anyway,  it would just be nice to talk to someone,  it could be about anything I just need to feel not so alone. And a distraction would be nice.",Hey there.,I'm here feel free to message anytime
"Hello please, can I talk to someone to hear please but my life is really hard,my prayers nolonger work and I feel like I can't continue with my life 😭😭😭",You need to get support. Ask your minister and a medical professional. Join a support group. Prayers are difficult. Find ones that cheer you up. God will bring you relief. Maybe in ways you don't expect. Little by little. Look for the signs. Look for good things,I'm here to talk about whatever is making you feel this way. What's wrong?
"I am 23 this year. I am under a lot of pressure right now. I often feel like committing suicide. No matter what l try to do, l can't do it. Even if l try to study or go to jobs, it's only a matter of time. I feel a lot of pressure on my head, I get depressed and stop when I can't bear it. Everything is fine.

I also have overthinking, social anxiety and introversion. It's hard to talk to people other than my family and those who are close to me, words won't come out of my mouth, I can't speak whats in my mind. When I go to places where there are many other people, I tremble and walk strangely.My hands shakes sometimes, I think that happens when I'm nervous. I have no energy to do anything. Even if I have a wash, it feels like I  ran a marathon. Also, I don't understand how to talk with some people and how to behave with them. Sometimes I don't know how to express my feelings. I have only few friends.

Family members, relatives and some friends pressure me to do a job. I know that I cant do a job at the moment.They hurt me by telling stuffs like im unlucky. I have done everything I know, counselling, taking medicine, there is no difference. I don't know what else to do.","It sounds like there is a lot resistance in you, and a lot of different beliefs that you think are stopping you from living the life you want. If you're an overthinker use that to your benefit. For example ponder about the possibility that what your telling yourself is a creation of your mind to keep you safe but is it a reality and fact? Take a look at your life and journal what are facts and separately what are your thoughts around it, and dont judge yourself for whatever it is that you wrote.
Then try to find one small thing that you could improve - maybe there is clutter in your room?sort it out, maybe you have plenty clothes that you dont wear anymore- go through it and get rid of the unused ones, maybe there are dishes in the sink- wash them(do this everyday) and see how you feel 🙂",I'm here to talk if you need

"I've been battling major depression since I was 15, am now 46. Lately is getting worse, enhancing other issues like OCD, ADHD... It's a battle combined with taking care of my parents, with dementia. 
I'm at my last breath.
Need to quit my job so I can focus on myself and my parents, but it's a struggle to pay the bills and get another job after healing... No jobs as you get older",Hi I can help you out please connect with me on inbox,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a challenging time. It's clear that you're dealing with multiple layers of difficulty, and it's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being. Here are a few suggestions that might help you navigate these tough circumstances:

Seek Professional Help:

Reach out to mental health professionals such as therapists, counselors, or psychiatrists. They can provide you with the support and guidance needed to manage depression, OCD, and ADHD.
Consider discussing medication options with a healthcare professional if they believe it might be beneficial for your mental health.
Build a Support System:

Connect with friends, family, or support groups. Sharing your struggles with others can provide emotional support and help alleviate feelings of isolation.
Self-Care:

Make self-care a priority. This can include activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and a sense of peace. It's crucial to take care of yourself, especially when dealing with the challenges of caring for parents with dementia.
Explore Financial Assistance:

Look into available financial assistance programs or services that may be able to support you during this difficult time. Government agencies, non-profit organizations, or community resources might be able to provide assistance.
Job Transition:

If you're considering leaving your current job, explore options for part-time or flexible work that allows you to balance your caregiving responsibilities and take care of your mental health.
Plan and Budget:

Create a realistic budget that takes into account your financial needs and explore ways to cut unnecessary expenses. Financial counselors may be able to help you with this process.
Explore New Job Opportunities:

If and when you decide to look for a new job, consider your skills and experience. There are opportunities for older individuals in various fields, and networking can be a valuable resource.
Community Resources:

Reach out to local community resources, social services, or charitable organizations that may offer assistance, advice, or support for individuals facing challenging circumstances.
Legal and Financial Advice:

Consider seeking legal and financial advice to understand your options, especially if you're contemplating leaving your job. There may be legal protections or financial strategies that can help you navigate this transition.
Remember that it's okay to ask for help and that taking care of your mental health is a priority. If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a mental health crisis hotline or a local mental health emergency service. You're not alone, and there are people and resources available to support you."

"14 months ago my husband turned our world upside down - he left the family home . 
Previously we had done what we could to make him happy, hosted bbqs for his mates went to concerts, shopping etc. 
he had been ‘moody’ to the extreme for 2 months before going. 
Turns out his mood was guilt- he had found pleasure else where, and had done several times in the 30 year marriage. Since leaving he has had several relationships with sex workers and even moved in with one. 
He won’t talk to his grown up children, stating via text that that’s their choice. 
He’s made getting a Divorce hard work and has left me in financial hardship.
Why is it so hard to get divorces and have financial independence from someone like this (narcissistic). 
I need to be free of him in order to find a way to live my life!","hey sweet heart, how long have you being going through this craze feelings ?",I'm so sorry you're going through this I went through similar and it's a nightmare when you're in it.

I know what it is like to have no one there to help you out when you feel alone. I had to let go of everyone, so I can be with myself to love myself. Being by yourself is NOT a bad thing, it is a time to find out who you really are. Ask God/ Universe, what it is that you are showing me? Being by yourself is a blessing not a curse. You need to take a deep breath and be grateful for what you have and how far you have come. You are taking a HUGE step by reaching out to people. That is the first step. Maybe you can go and get Therapy, so you can express yourself with, if not writing things down on paper is a way you can see what you need to do. Right now, you need to take care of number one, that is YOU. You can ask the Arch Angels help, ask for guidance. I love You so much! You are stronger then you know and smarter then you think.

Always remember that when you have mental health issues your brain NEEDS you to feel bad. Because that's what it feeds off. And those bad thoughts aren't real.

"Hy there. I'm new! Actually I was looking for a group like this as I have a mental breakdown.
To the Situation: I'm doing LARP (live action roleplay) imagen a fantasy game, only that it's real live and you are playing out your character like in an impro theater.
So I was part of this FB group and asked for cons on a specific date. As I play a high fantasy creatur and not every con wants these I also posted a pic of my character.
It startet with laughing faces and went on with not very nice comments, about how my character isn't good for anything...
Keep in mind that that character means a lot o me. I made a lot of her costume myselfe such as the staff she caries...

I'm normally okay with such things. If I post a pic I can accept a little backlash.
Thenther was this very long comment that on first sight was nice and friendly and even gave me a site with con dates. I thanked him and concentrated on something else.
2h or so later I open FB and read a comment under my thanks that said ""who is going to tell her?""
I read the comment again and discovered that it was sarcasm. Very clearly even. But I didn't see that at forst because I just thought (or wanted to think) that there is at least one nic person in that group.

So as I said normally I don't care about the opinion of others. But for the question of con dates I only got hate over my costume.
I was now at home for 4 months as I'm not doing very good with my mental health.
I'm lying in bed and cry. I haven't had such a episode in a long time now...
I just can't understand why people are so mean. I would never laugh at someone about their character or anything else. You never know what they are going through.

Sry for the wall of text but i needed that...","The comments are getting a little unsupportive on this post unfortunately.

As individuals we all have our our breaking points and things that upset us HOWEVER it’s not for any member within this group to tell another member that their ‘difficulties are not problematic enough’ compared to problems that others may face. 
We do not judge. 

We take a kindness approach in our group and would ask that everyone remembers this. 

Thank you","I've been microdosing over a month now.  That and medical Marijuana and therapy 4x a month has been so much more helpful than prescription drugs. Also,  I think it's important that you incorporate therapy with microdosing.   The mushrooms really open up your mind especially in therapy.   I've been digging up childhood memories I've buried...and now I feel like I'm healing from them.  I also feel scripts slap a zombie bandaid on you and you just float around just trying to make it day to day.  I didn't even feel human on meds.  I hated existing 😪. Now, I actually feel hopeful.   I wish people were more accepting of natural medicine. it has got off my anxiety, bipolar, depression, panics and mental health issues. trips.michael_ on Instagram can get you some and guide you 🥺♥️

Shrooms are the best. I usually get mine from eastinchris123_  on instagram i always buy from him, he’s reliable 💯.I Can’t stop taking shrooms because it calms me down from my depression"
Has anyone been prescribed quetiapine and can tell me if they worked or not please? I was given a 'working diagnosis' of BPD a couple years ago and have just been left to deal with it alone until now. Today I've been prescribed quetiapine but the doctor mentioned they can make me feel sedated a lot and now I'm scared to take them. She said to take them at night time.. Will they affect me the following day if I do?,Yes I took them and they were fine I took them at night I was stable on them as I have BPD too,"I've been prescribed them too , and bit nervous"
"My husband, Tim Sitar is leaving me because of my mental health. I have panic attacks, I have anxiety I have borderline personality, disorder, depression. ￼ and this is all from growing up in an alcoholic family. I did everything I could to try to explain to him but he didn’t want any part of it. I’m nobody I’m not a therapist I’m just a person who’s been to therapy most of my life, but I think he’s a narcissist and I think I made a good mark for him my husband before Tim died. I didn’t see anyone for five years and let me tell you he charmed me and charmed me and charmed me. I think it’s called love bombing and I fell for it. I’m not sad because he’s leaving North Carolina and going back to New York. I’m sad because my little dog Jazzy really liked him and we are in a separation. In North Carolina you have to wait a year of separation and then you can file for divorce so he used to come over to my apartment just to help me out, bring things trying to make himself look like a good guy. But it breaks my heart because my dog hears people coming up and down the stairs and she thinks it’s Tim and she whines and whines and wines and I try to tell her that he’s never coming back just breaks my heart. ￼ nor do I want him to come back.

When getting good news is it normal to feel shock like no way it can’t be. To me? No it seems too good to be true.

"Please bare with me. 
I am currently suffering with covid (my first infection with it),
But my MH is taking a proper battering, I am struggling to breathe coz my nose is blocked but running at the same time, anything I do, ie move, blow my nose, take a drink, get too hot or cool, sets off my cough, which is now at the point I’m being sick when coughing.

I feel like what is the point? 

I message  do my boss today to say I was still shadowing positive on LFT, so I wouldn’t be in work until I test negative and can breathe properly without a mask on (anyone with a sniffle work, must wear a mask, practice policy). The response from the boss was, “no not in work until negative LFT, as I have covid now and I haven’t been anywhere but work on Thursday so I’ve caught it from someone there.”
 
I have been made to feel that I have given TB covid even though I have off since last Friday. 

I’m feeling very isolated and alone, I have an exam in 4 weeks and atm can’t be bothered to revise let alone turnup to it. 

I’m barely eating (thanks to a lack of smell and taste) but I know that won’t help recovery fm anything.

I can’t even cry or get frustrated as it sets me off coughing.

Thank you for listening.","This is how I felt when I had covid too. The symptoms will take a while to pass too. 
It will affect you as covid makes you feel really rough xx","I've just come out of hospital for 3 nights with covid. The infection messes with your mind, makes you confused and low, for people suffering mental health issues it is harrowing. I was in a room alone with no TV,  it was tough."
"Hi.
I'm Rob from Canada. Thanks for allowing me to join your group. I joined because I'm hoping to get some support, understanding, acceptance from some - if not all of you. I suffer from Cyclothymia (a mood disorder), I get more than my fair share of ""low mood days"" which can last for a few days - up to a week or longer. I really have no close friends, no real support so I'm hoping that I'll find that here. Thank You.","Welcome, you can send me a friend request. I will be your friend",I've never heard of that before
"Now lately whenever I’m about to get impulsive and worry about family stuff I ask myself 

“Should I really worry about?”

“How is it in anyway gonna effect me?”

Before I worried so much to the point I’d give myself anxiety and panic attacks 

Example: 
Since I did my surgery mom’s doctor appointment and personal stuff was put on hold due to her helping me recover 

I know deep down I’m worried but I am done stating only to get yelled at and scolded by her 

Wanna do it? 

Great 

Don’t wanna do it?

Not my problem 

Now now I do love her but like I know over and over for 27 years if I try to remind she will only push me away so why should I be dumb ya know? 

Yes it’s selfish but I’m so done caring for others if none gonna give this back

"Hi everyone,  I recently referred myself for support/counselling. I had my assessment yesterday and they advised going forward that it will be a group counselling session via teams. Has anyone done counselling this way? 
I don't think it will work for me as I'm also autistic which they know about. Apparently I have to be involved in the sessions, I do not do social interaction well. Any advice","Well yesterday they didn't send me the link till after 1pm and it started at 1pm so I didn't show up explaining why. I then got an email back saying thats my first appointment missed, if I miss another one then I will be off there programme,  also if I don't reply to the email or call within 10 days they will also refer me back to my doctors.

Hello I don’t know where to start on this never really spoke about stuff I just let things bottle up until last night I’m just looking for a little advice it all started nearly a month ago my best friend passed away Cus of her mental health and each passing day I feel myself slipping and this sort of emptiness I have been drinking a lot more that usually it’s the only thing that seems to numb this,Gradually face your feelings. Be brave. Gradually give up the alcohol. No solution. We like happy feelings. But we have to face painful feelings too. Good luck my dear,I’m having a bad day I don’t want to believe this anymore

"Hi, can I have someone’s advice please and how to cope or see if anybody’s been in a similar situation because I’m seriously struggling to cope this year has been so crappy! We were expecting our little boy to be born in April he arrived perfect and healthy but when he turned 2 months old I sat and held my dads hand and watched him take his last breathe as when I gave birth to him I found out a couple of weeks later my dad had cancer and it had spread everywhere and there was nothing we could do for him and it’s took a massive toll on my mental health, I feel absolutely awful because I just want to be the best mom I can be for my little boy but I’ve never grieved like this and I’m struggling to the point I don’t want to get out of bed I don’t bother with my appearance and just want to be left alone all of the time🫣 sorry for the long post!

Go to your doctors and ask for some loss and bereavement counselling or grief support , go and ask for help hunny . Please reach out . I am sending you so much love x","I’m so sorry to hear this .. My struggle with a newborn and depression aren’t from the same place as yours is, but I know how devastating feeling low when you have a baby is - I was in a womens refuge with a 5 month old and no family or friends and I just felt like giving up. But you won’t. At some point your baby’s  needs and survival surpass your own and you’ll find  the strength to move and be a role model. If you need help to do that, then that’s just fine .. but you’ll do it.  You needed your dad like your child needs you. That will kick in somehow, someway.  Be good to yourself. Ask for help. Accept help and listen to your baby and your dads spirit xxx"

"We are certainly living in a difficult time and it takes some emotional processing.  We have been locked down and isolated and here in NYC the violence has been unprecedented.  Last weekend we waited without defense for the rioting to come to my neighborhood.  Thankfully we were passed by.

I have been deleting sites and getting rid of negative things that do not serve me.  This action has felt empowering.  Education is empowering.",That's awesome.

Hi. I am new to the group & new to mental health struggles. Looking to make new friends who know what I am going through.,Good morning,Iam going through the same thing and are getting bad thoughts
,Hi there. I had a good day yesterday. I finally cured my new phone daymare and realised a few things about myself. I've always been wary of technology and because I did it myself I have more confidence to do it again. Success is failure turned inside out.

Maybe I deserve this lacrimal duct 

I deserve all the bad things I get to me

Mental health not so good,Mine was horrible at the beginning I have been in counseling off and on for twenty  years it has gotten better I still have sad days and days when something triggers my ptsd. Or when I get overwhelmed with things seem to be happening over and over again,If it’s not good the best thing is to talk about  your mental health this is a good group and very supportive you also can get a therapist and a psychiatrist also I would start with a counselor first until you’re comfortable
I've had enough of life nothing will ever change its pointless I’ve tried my best and given my heart but still nothing is good enough 😭😭,"Nothing will change? I was homeless jobless, relationshipless and empty in june this year. August I got a caravan ( homeless sorted ). October I got a full time job ( job sorted ) now I'm working on a relationship again. 

Story is. Life doesn't come with a remote. If yiu want to change it then you have to do it yourself","If nothing has been working then you've not got someone showing you that has been there before you, figured it out and now can be your guide. My guess is that you've been trying to figure this out on your own and you don't have the right tools and that's why you feel frustrated... am I right?"
Hey everyone X hope you are all ok xx just wanted to ask if anyone has had a mental health assessment through the access team at the hospital mental health department and knows what happens next in terms of being contacted back in regards to the assessment and support available etc I had the assessment mid November but I'm not on any medication or treatment for my mental Illnesses due to my GP not considering it a good idea until I was assessed by the relevant professionals this because of the extent of which my psychological state of mind deteriorated. I'm just confused about what happens next and wondered if anyone has any advice for me please thanks in advance xx,Give the Access Team a call and ask them. Generally after an assessment they will determine whether you are at risk enough to admit and if not they will close the file. Sometimes they will refer you to community mental health for follow up.,If the Access team deem you are a serious risk to your well being they would attempt to find a bed for you in the mental health unit. If not they might refer you to the community team and a member from there would get it touch with you. Alternatively they might refer you back to your GP suggesting a mental health care plan where you would receive a number of sessions free of charge with a mental health practitioner. The access team should have told you what their plan was. As Sonja said give them a call to clarify the situation. Don't fear the MHU I worked there for 5 years and it is one of the best in the state.
Are there any professionals on here where we can get genuine help and advice please? Thank you,Thank you🙂,If the issue is BPD I can maybe help

"I Just joined this group because I’ve found myself with nowhere left to turn. I’m not one who likes to make his problems public, but when it comes down to it, I don’t trust therapists, or really any professional for that matter. I don’t really have any friends I can speak to. I do a great job of making everything look like it’s okay and I don’t want to ruin that illusion for my family. That’s kinda the reason this post is anonymous. But the truth is that I’m really not ok. I would say life has taken a turn for the worse, but that would imply things were going well to begin with. I have been so distraught that I can’t even eat at this point. Life just seems so hopeless and meaningless with no signs of things getting better anytime soon. I’m watching my relationship fall apart despite my best efforts to keep it together. What was once a promising job has since become dead-end with no possibility of improving. I’ve gone from a straight A student to struggling to maintain a C. And it seems that every effort I make to improve the areas of my life I feel need the most work, ends up in me taking two steps backwards. I’ve always been very mentally resilient and able to move past the hard times, but now I just feel hopeless. I don’t feel happy anymore. I have been trying to avoid using the word depressed, but I just feel so deeply saddened by the state of things at this point that I’m not sure what other word to use. Maybe despondent? I guess the whole purpose behind me making this post is me trying to give myself one small tiny sliver of hope that maybe things can get better in life, but truthfully, I don’t see that as a possibility. The job I want in life doesn’t want me, the relationship I’ve been so invested in for the last few years is fading away and all I can do is watch, and the worst part is I have absolutely nobody to talk to about it. I‘ve tried talking to a therapist but it didn’t work well. I don’t trust them and I don’t trust the idea of “oh just try another one and another one and another one and another one and another one until you’ve spent your life savings trying out 137 different therapists”. I guess I’ll end this with a plead for someone out there who took the time to read this, who really wishes to try and help me at least have a little hope in life, and who can make me feel like I can be happy again because I haven’t been happy for a long time and I don’t know how to be anymore. I’m sorry I’m advance for such a rant and for being so heavily impacted by these relatively trivial issues","Trust goes both ways I was married for 23 years my ex left me the very first time I entered a. psych hospital was left feeling abandoned and my trust in people went downhill it took me alone time to trust a therapist but I found one and bit by bit I was able to tell her my story she never judged I still have problems  with being abandoned
￼you are making a big step in telling your story it’s a brave thing to do if you trust yourself to post your story on Facebook maybe you will try another therapist there’s lots of different kinds if you decide to go to a therapist tell that person your feeling of trust be honest I am going to an outpatient program that I attend three days a week three hours a day you can listen to others speak and when you comfortable you can talk","If you are a bit open and committed, please look into this.
Go to Youtube and search for ""Inner Engineering - Finding the Source of Your Happiness"".
Do the practice ""Inner Engineering"".
I believe it will stabilise your emotion and give your mental clarity. 
PS: If you are rich, you can spend on many therapists."
"So in March 22nd my toxic workplace intensified to the point I no longer felt my mental health was safe.  I applied for FMLA and took every bit of that approved time to heal. I was diagnosed with chronic ptsd, depression and anxiety. I have been going to therapy regularly throughout and it’s been helpful in helping me understand my reactions to others negative behavior. People really be doing dumb shit. 
Anyway I’m about to begin another job, less stress and a little less pay which is fine. I’ve been off for over 3 months and I’m struggling with the question, “am I ready?”  
I’m medicated, but I haven’t really learned any healthy ways to bring down the over production of stress hormones in confrontational situations. I don’t plan to have any as I’m easy to get along with but my last experience in the workforce really did a number on me. Anyone have suggestions? 🙏",I have anxiety really bad when I start having anxiety I breathe blow in air in your nose and blow air out your mouth calm music is good I use a list of things I have to do when finish a task cross it off you will glad you accomplish your task,"If you are asking yourself if you are ready, and this brings on Anxiety then the answer is NO.
Only when you can answer yourself YES to the question will you be ready.
Three months is a very short time, remember this is a journey you are walking and not a marathon"
"I'm miserable at the moment. I'm so tired of just being on my phone, nearly every waking second and being alone. I wanna live, enjoy life, explore, hang out with friends, travel, do something different every day. But I'm stuck,  I'm in poverty and there's just nothing I can do. Plus, I don't have any real friends. 

I guess, I have only myself to blame for being in this situation. I wasn't diligent about a career, not settling down anywhere long enough permanently. I gave up on friendships, because I became a independent free spirit of a loner. I'm regretting it all. Especially the later. There's just no doubt, I don't want to be alone anymore. I want friends and possibly a love interest. It's not too much to ask, but it's gonna take effort. Maybe, I just shouldn't have been a 'rolling stone' it's got me nowhere in life. I've settled down in a city, where I don't know anyone. I find it hard to make and develop new friendships. 

A life spent on a mobile/cell phone 📱 daily is definitely no life at all. There's more to life, a world out there and I'm stuck on my phone. Due to poverty and a lack of real close friendships. I'm feeling sorry for myself. If anyone is free at all, I would appreciate a chat. I'm emotional and I need support. So very sorry I sound pathetic, needy and clingy. 

Wishing you all blessed good  mental health and a good weekend.",Hey there are you able to leave the house and be confident enough to start an activity I.e sport or class like art etc or just get out in fresh air at parks to start with if not.  You won't magically make friends but have to start going out of your normal environment even if you just walk past people initially say hello and smile . Sml steps. Make a plan with very small goals.,"If you are happy to leave your home, why not look into volunteering.  Even an afternoon or day every couple of weeks will bring life to you and open more doors"
"Hi, looking for some advice! I am not sure what to do at this point, I am 32 weeks pregnant and unable to work this far along due to my health issues, I am not able to afford anything now as I have run out of money. I did apply for foodstamps and got approved for a small amount, but my foodstamps last for maybe a week or two and I don’t get them for another 2 weeks, I applied for online and am waiting for them to call me. I have no gas to get to food banks and delivery jobs like DoorDash and Uber aren’t hiring in Atlanta because of how many people do it here. I am so low on food at this point I’m getting really worried, I’ve applied for credit cards and constantly get declined. Just wondering, has anyone else been in my situation? And what did you do? I wish I didn’t get pregnant at 19 and I just feel like a horrible mom to be in this situation and it’s really embarrassing opening up about it because I know I will be judged.",I did not have my first child until I was twenty nine.,"If you aren’t receiving WIC, that helps with some food. Not sure if Metro has assistance based on income. I had my first child at 19. I had the support of my parents at that time. I was out of state when I was pregnant with my third child.

"Hi all. I got an accident on monday the 19th at 10am. I was coming from the market crossed the road and passed between 2 parked  buses at the back. Unfortunately, one reversed while i was crossing and squeezed me towards the parked one. I started screaming for help, i could not move, it kept reversing, i could not escape, the pain on my waist thighs and legs was too much that i was numb, i was screaming and what hurts me the most, it was in broad daylight and people were WATCHING ME SCREAM, as i was seconds away from death. I did not even think of praying my last prayers. I only thought of how my child will be motherless. Eventually, the driver heard my scream and drove frontwards where i was released and fell down. So many people crowded there, i was in 
Pain, i was crying begging the idlers to take me to hospital, luckily, God sent an angel. A guy who new me and called me by name and i asked him to take me to hosp and call my family. I have soft tissue injuries amd muscle trauma, i have been on bedrest, mentally tortured and i do not know how to cope with this. I keep remembering how i saw myself dying, how people are heartless how the watched me without even shouting or alarming the driver that he was 
Crushing me as he was reversing more and more. !! This case was reported but the driver is not cooperating, the pain i was in i honestly dint care of justice or not but ssince now am much better, i have 3 days only to decide whether to proceed with this case and sue the driver and owner of the bus. I feel like its gotta take a long time till i get compensated here l, its a long process.  Am mentally tortured, i was 2 seconds from being crushed to death as people WATCHED?!?! THIS image is really disturbing me. I havent even healed by the fact that i lost my dad on dec 3rd 2023, he was killed by people we know well and guess what?! No JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED. NO one was arrested, my dad died, we buried him.
Am really stressed,am an only child to my mum. Am jobless. Am hurt. I feel drained. Stressed. I donno what to do. I feel like i failed my dad, and am failing myself by not pushing for justice for the accident i had...

"Today was probably one of the worst days of my life, 33M/UK.

Basically been suffering with anxiety for the past 5 years took medication all was well until the meds stopped working back in August 2022, since tried 5 different ADs none worked had all the horrible side effects/withdrawals. 

Didn't sleep last night at all as I had a Drs phone appointment today 12pm spoke to the Dr he asked me to come into the surgery to get blood pressure taken and I just folded, Crying my heart out told my father I didn't wanna live anymore told my Dr I was a mess for a good 4 hours. Felt ashamed, embarrassed all the guilt has anyone experienced this? Please tell me this is normal ive always been treated for Anxiety but today was the worst depression ever! Hope I never see it again it was almost like a panic depression attack.

"I do have a boyfriend and I do have family around me that knows about my disorders but they do not understand my disorders and they don’t know how to help me and I feel therapy doesn’t really work, so maybe having somebody who understands my disorders whether that be they know about it or they have it as well and understands what I’m going through would be somewhat helpful. I’m only 20 and I feel like nothing helps and I feel very hopeless I feel like it’s only going downhill for me as I get older and I would rather have people around me who understand what I’m going through then have people around me who can’t help me at all and don’t know how it feels to have what I have if anybody understands BPD or has it as well please let me know so I don’t feel like I’m alone",You are not alone 🤗♥️,If you google BPD you may find an online support group either in your area or not.

"I used to be a train driver but in 2020 someone laid across the tracks in front of me and because of the speed of the train, I was unable to stop in time.  I cried for days after that but when the crying stopped I began to experience things that I know now were not real. After a couple of months of experiencing these delusions I tried to take my own life. I don't know how I became known to the police or social services but suddenly they were knocking on my door and I was sectioned under section 2 of the mental health act. I spent a month under observation in the Warneford hospital in Oxford and another two weeks at a ""step up house"" in Headington.

I eventually returned home and I started to experience the same delusions, and spent the summer of 2020 locked away in my home tormented by the delusions that had gotten me sectioned.

Later that year in late October I had a meeting at the Warneford hospital, Neill unit. After the meeting and still suffering from my delusions I had a meltdown in the car park and was sectioned again under section three of the mental health act. Where I spent another month in hospital. I was released from the secure unit in late November and returned home.

Thankfully this time the delusions stayed away and after a month of being clear of these delusions I returned to work.

I was not cleared to drive a train as my sick leave had been the result of a mental health issue. So I was asked to help out with other duties at Oxford station that were not safety critical, which I was more than happy to do while I waited for a doctors report to clear me to drive trains again.

Eventually I was asked if I could fulfil the role of depot admin, which I did for about a year, while waiting on the doctors report to see if they would let me drive a train again.

While I was waiting to see if I would get the all clear from the doctor. The depot admin role was taken from me and advertised even though I was doing the admin job.

A few weeks went by and the doctors said I was still not stable enough to drive, but now because they had taken the admin job from me I was now on redeployment within the company. The problem with this is that every job I have applied for and even though I am more than qualified for the jobs I have been refused these jobs.

I don't know where to turn to. I feel the company I work for are actively trying to get rid of me and are being dishonest as to the reasons why. If I get redeployed within the company they have to pay me 80% of my former wage, which is an agreement they made with the unions. However, the positions I am applying for are paid a lot less and I feel this is the real reason I am being turned down for jobs I could easily do.

I hope this wasn't too long. Thank you for listening.","Firstly, It's a shame to see this happened to you but good to see that you worked your way through it.

Secondly, I see you're based in Oxford. Assuming this is Oxford, England - there are strict rules around equality and no one can refuse you to do a job because of your mental health (unless deemed unsafe hence the train driving block) so I'd be going to my union to discuss this further, especially if you're applying for jobs you know you can do and are willing to drop pay.",If you have family legal protection on your home insurance they maybe able to help with this 😀good luck & sorry you’ve had to go through this

"I could really use some insight. My 19 year old son was recently diagnosed as SchizoEffective Bipolar Disorder. He previously had been diagnosed with ADD, ADHD, Anxiety and he has Type I diabetes. In the last year his personality has changed drastically. He has gone from outgoing, personable, confident to socially withdrawn and often paranoid. He sees a psychiatrist, physician,counselor and a med manager. He has had 3 jobs in the last year. He did not get “fired” but one he could not lift the required weight, (he only weighs 110 lbs) the other two his anxiety was so great he had to quit. He was having panic attacks so severe that he believed he was having heart attacks. He called the paramedics twice for assistance. They did record an irregularity in his heartbeat. It was later determined by the doctors to be caused by his level of anxiety. I want to be a supportive parent but also encourage him to seek a path towards the best life possible. So far he has NOT sought out street drugs or alcohol to ease his pain for which I am so grateful. My heart is broken for my son.

If you feel like no one loves you, then take up that role and love yourself intentionally. Adore yourself, appreciate yourself, and praise all your great qualities. Soon enough, you will feel better. 
Also, if you feel someone gets close to you because they wants something from you, then immediately cut them off or don't give them what you think they want from you. People who truly love you will hang around and make you feel appreciated. 
What I'm saying is that you love and appreciate yourself first...then, you can start to feel others' love."

And our minds ought to be controlled by us and not the other way round. That is where your recovery starts from. We are counseled to guard our hearts with all diligence for our of it comes the issues of life. You can harness the power in your mind by following the steps below:
1. Censor your thoughts. Sieve what thoughts enter your mind. Be conscious of what information you allow into your mind. That is where all the information that enters into you from all the happenings around you per time are processed into thoughts that eventually become actions that hurt you physically and emotionally. 
2. Decongest your mind:  As much as possible begin a process of decongesting your mind now. As you read this, begin to sweep your mind by deliberately weeding out every negative thoughts that have taken root in your mind. 
3. Meditation: Deliberately and consciously start reprogramming your mind with positive thoughts. Think and meditate only on thoughts and situations that have made you happy and joyful before your present condition.
Conclusion: Be very purposeful and deliberate in applying these steps on a daily basis without fail and within the shortest possible time, you will find your out of this present condition.

"Today I feel the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. I'm so beyond disappointed in myself and I'm not sure what to do at this point other than cry and get it out before I have to get my girls from the sitter and tell them that no only did I let myself down today but I let them down more. I was suppose to have a side job lined up today so I could make the money I needed to get my girls and I into a room that I was hoping to rent for the month (and then month by month after that) but the job fell through. So I get to tell my babies that we have no where to go and we will be sleeping outside because the shelters I called are at capacity and 211 and the salvation army were no help at all. I'm so upset and I can't stop crying. They were excited to have a place to call home for awhile and now we have nowhere and are going to have to sleep outside until I can get another side job to make the last little bit I need. 

How do I make this as safe as I can for them, keep them fed, happy, and just alive while living like that. I'm not prepared and I don't know whatto say let alone do.

Try sitting them down and explain that gma is 80 years old and has hearing issues and there will be times that there will be loud voices so she can hear. You will try not do it all the time but they need to understand that this will happen from time to time and they will need to try and find away to cope with it. Maybe wearing headphones or ear buds might block out some of the loud voices and might help them cope that bit better

But I’m not sure if that’s considered a scrap book is it?",I think that’s a great idea you are very imaginative I would loved to share that idea with others if you don’t mind,"It can be about anything, memories, tickets of events you went too, it can be fabric you love to touch, a specific scent you love to smell. Paper of your favorite spots, pictures, all kinds of colors, part of a plant or flower...anything you set your mind too!"
How many times do you have to fail at something before you realise you should quit!!,"I have a rescue dog for 6 months now and I struggle to take her for a walk without her reacting to triggers.  I am determines to improve her behaviour but feel I am getting nowhere.  Sometimes we have good walks and I think progress is being made and then a bad experience and I feel I am failing.  I haven't failed until I give up and I can't give up because she is special to me.
Am I failing to see that I am unable to succeed?","It depends on the individual. Failure is just a mindset. If you never give up then how can you ever fail? It’s up to you when you decide enough is enough. If that’s after 10 times cool, if that’s after 50 times cool, if that’s never then that’s also cool! It’s entirely up to you! "
I feel sad cos m gonna be 29 this yr but iv got nothing to show for it  except having a baby that I didn't want 😥 feel like I should be getting married and having a career like everyone else but no one wants me 😥,Hi did you not have a choice regarding the baby? When I was younger my mother insisted on what she wanted and I felt I had no choice in the matter.,"It doesn't happen for everyone.

Is it normal to sleep while depressed,"Yes, totally normal, Disrupted sleep is very common",It is for me. I call them depression naps. Depression saps our energy making us want to sleep. I'll take a nap but won't let it last more than an hour.
How do you break feee from a strict family. Like does anyone ever feel like they are doing what’s okay for them but family makes you feel they know better. I know deep in me that I should do what’s best for me. But what’s the best mindset to build that emotional strength. Please I need answers and I’d love if people could drop their personal experiences.,Move away and don't tell them where you are going. I didn't do that and I told them to keep away from me but they still kept interfering.,It is hard but remember that sometimes it is critical to step back and see the option available
"Ok I need some advice on what to do. My daughter is incarcerated. She is in the Sevier county jail and is being refused her mental health meds. First they said she had a bad urine test and their protocols said they withheld all medications for 30 days . Then yesterday they told me that she would be receiving her mental health medications and at this point she has mentally deteriorated. The medical personnel I have spoke with outside of the jail says she will continue to deteriorate the longer she goes without her mental health medications. I am here to tell you mental health is serious and if anyone is being treated for it their meds should not be withheld for more than 48 hours. This should be reviewed and not permitted. They can verify the inmates medical records. I just think this is cruel to a person with mental health issues!! Anyone not just my daughter!! She has seizures and they gave her the meds for that which she also has an expired prescription for, but as of today decided she will no longer receive these. I just don't understand why they do this to anyone? She hasn't even been to court to be tried for what she was accused of. What happen to innocent until proven guilty but that is not my worry. How can I get her mental health medications to her and updat her scripts? She has one update script and the nurses opinion is it will make her sleep so they will not give it to her?? It is a mental health med to calm her and stabilize her and because it may let her sleep she will not give it to her? Now she is taking her seizure meds too?? This is just wrong. I know I will.get some negative fees back from a few but right or wrong everyone deserves to be treated for their medical needs regardless  if it is heart, blood pressure or diabetes. I know that they are giving saboxin to the recovering drug Addicts of the jail and that is awesome but what about the needs of the mental health and medically needs of others?? What can I do to help not just my daughter but others in the same situation?","It's really painful to read your post. From what I understand you're in the US? I don't know now much about the law but I guess there is a process where you can sue the state and make them give your daughter medication. Maybe there are human rights/advocacy groups that specialize in these cases. Any way you are a brave and loving parent and you are absolutely right, this is cruel beyond words. People with mental health issues often break the law because their illness and they should not be in jail but cared for. I truly hope you will find a group that can help you wherever you are and that your daughter receives care and compassion.","It saddens me to read this!! I don't know about that jail, but in my counties jail the ""nurses"" and ""medical team"" are not jail employees they are employed by some company....I would call and find out what company runs the medical part of the jail then call them and ask to speak to someone in charge.."
"How long to wait after a mental health crisis to make a huge life change?

November 2021, my mental health started declining pretty rapidly after my son turned 1 1/2. (Postpartum depression turned major depression). This led to extreme anger, life-threatening behaviors, and a general lack of ability to cope with everyday life. I was an inpatient in the hospital for a few days twice (August 2022 & November 2022). 

After my last stay, I became internally motivated to get better. Since then, I have been the emotionally healthiest I have ever been. I have made serious changes to my behavior, my outlook, everything, and I’m thriving. 

This entire time, I’ve been wanting another child, but emotionally, haven’t been ready, however, now I am. My husband and I have been discussing the possibility of starting to try for another baby in 3-4 months, and I really want to, but I also want to make sure my deep desire for another baby doesn’t cause me to rush into anything. 

How long would you wait after a mental health crisis to make that kind of a life change?","If you’re in the U.K., look at referring yourself to Home Start. They are a nationwide support for families with children under 5. You may have a local Facebook page in your area.","It seems like you are in a good place. I don't think you have to look back at the past and worry. Instead you can look at it as a learning curve about going through hard times and getting over it.

Having another child is a completely different matter. You have to make sure that you have having this child because you want this child whole heartedly and you are capable of raising this child until your services are no longer essential. 
If you are having a child to fill a void in your life, it's not wise. 
Hope this helps 🤗"
"My cousin Is Psychotic period I was driving and picked him up from the road. And I've done that before. He was staying at my house before. And it got bad because he talked to himself and talk really loud. And in bed all the night and he ended up leaving. And now hes back today, because.  I wanted to do some things to help him. And now I realize I'm not going to be able to help him. And he is saying all kinds of stuff. And he already thinks that we killed his dog when he was here before, but his dog died of an infection. I don't know what to do because i'm actually a little afraid of him",Hospital intervention immediately,It sounds like hospital is the best place for your cousin! Isn't there anyone else in your family you can talk to..don't put all the responsibility on your shoulders..get help!
"Hi all I need to rant if that's OK. I'm really struggling with one of my children who is daughter age 17.
She has gone off the rails. She has just been diagnosed with the highest adhd and depression but I strongly believe she has a personality disorder too.
It started 2 years ago when she was part of a attempted sexual assault and police never found him. Then she had no support in school from this and she was bullied for what happened. She soon dropped out of school which was her last year and just before doing her gcses.she was self-harming by cutting her arms and legs up. She then enrolled in collage as she really wanted to be a equine veterinary surgeon but girls there was jealous of how much she knew and could ride (we own 4 and she rides 3 of them plus other peoples) she had a girl there who was always telling others they was going to jump my daughter and beat her. Roll on a few weeks later and my daughter text me begging me to come get her as she went toilet and come back to a knife in her bag. The police was called before she had even text me again and then I rang her and a police officer told me that they was called because a student has said they see my daughter with a knife (funny enough it was the girl who was picking on my kid) she was kicked out even tho she said over a d over it wasn't hers and begged them to look for finger prints. She then started to cut more and more and started taking pills. She then asked me to get her help which I did but she has just got a new boyfriend and she is not my daughter anymore. She smoking weed everyday and is not acting like my daughter at all. She ran away from home for 24 hours with no contact (she wasn't anywhere) she then returned cocky and nasty to all of her siblings and me. I suffer with depression and have a bad heart just like her and I really can't take much more of this. Sorry this is long but I really need to get it out there as I am lost. I just want my daughter back",Im so sorry you are both dealing with the repercussions of a horrific crime. The ongoing trauma from what happened is quite possibly a massive part of what is happening for your daughter that is contributing  to all those behavioural things.  You may be right that she has those diagnosis too. But those behaviours can be totally trauma results.,It sounds like she needs counselling so sorry about what happened to her. She's clearly having a very rough time and doesn't have the chance to process and work through her feelings properly.
"Hope this is okay to post, i need to vent. Doing okay, hanging in there. I wish I had the confidence to say no to people. Everyone always has to come to me to run errands for them, ask me to find something lost, or go out of my way- when I'm already occupied. It's hard when you have clinical depression, and exposed to trauma and emotional/verbal abuse.","Hey 👋 I hope you are ok 👍 I was the same my whole life since a teen looked for outside validation from others. Experienced anxiety and depression  and wasn’t able to manage it affectively. I began a healing ❤️‍🩹 journey. Began to love myslef and no longer needed outside valadation. I rewired my brain and I’m so positive now. I want u to know it is possible to come out the dark and not only into the light but to be happy. I’m so positive and happy now. I teach people to say no, find clarity and direction and transform through my self-love coaching. Please 🙏 don’t think it’s not possible to change and learn it is.

This is not the case, and it is a really tricky case to overcome, sometimes, not always you have to say NO ""I come first"". If you can help yourself,  then you can evaluate how you can help others.
If you are not right in yourself how can you justify a good resolution for others?"
"Can anyone understand how i am feeling , i want to be away from others, i live with my family , responsible for everything…but i want alone time …. I am  wanting to escape everything and have some respite … not a holiday, a break from all i have been doing. During this time i have been struggling. 
No responsibilities, nothing, just focus on me , get myself well … 

Any suggestions welcome …","All you can do is stay somewhere quiet or a Friends that could give you peace, or tell the folk you live with how you feel","It sounds like you're going through a tough time and feeling overwhelmed with responsibilities. It's completely understandable to want some alone time and a break from everything.

Here are a few suggestions that may help:

Communicate with your family: Let them know how you're feeling and that you need some alone time. Ask if they can help take over some responsibilities for a short period of time to give you a break.

Find a quiet space: If you don't have a room to yourself, try to find a quiet space where you can be alone with your thoughts. This could be a park, a library, or even just a quiet corner of your home.

Take care of yourself: Use this time to focus on self-care. Take a warm bath, read a book, practice meditation or yoga, or just do something that you enjoy.

Seek professional help: If you're struggling with your mental health, it may be helpful to seek professional help. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and take breaks when you need them."
"I've been told that I am overwhelming because of texting too much, I think they are right. I feel awful about it, not offended though. I think it stems from not having any siblings, both my parents are deceased, all my children are adults and do not have time for me, I have no communication with my grandchildren, not by my choice, I have no friends, only my dog and 2 cats and my plants. So, I become a hermit and withdraw back into isolation. I have chronic illnesses and pain with mental health illnesses that make it difficult to socialize. Then there are those who just do not believe me when I tell them I do not feel well,  others ignore me, some tell me the ""all you got to do's."" I look at my phone and there's no one to talk to. My phone never rings, only if it is medical or something other. I keep telling myself it will get better,  but its really not getting better. It's been like this for 54 years. I have no spouse and I know no one will marry me due to all these health issues and if they do ill just be a burden because I need a lot of care and help. I feel like my life is wasting away and I'm just waiting for my last day here. I find that my only Hope is God. I read the Bible everyday and watch good sermons and teachings in YouTube because I do not have a local church to go to and if I did have one,  I do not feel well enough to go. I keep telling myself that I refuse to feel sorry for myself and will not look for pity from others. I just want to share some of my struggles with you. Perhaps I can be useful in encouraging others about no matter how hard it gets, no matter how terrible you feel,  I'm here to listen to you. You will never be overwhelming to me. I will never get tired of hearing you. What you share are not complaints to me. You matter to me. I care. ❤️","I watched a documentary on Netflix “Change your mind” and decided to try micro dosing on watched psilocybin capsules and it helped me

"Hi everyone. I’m going through a very stressful time right now. My adult son has had depression and anxiety for years and hasn’t stuck with treatment. He is now being treated for Bipolar disorder and starts a new med for Treatment resistant depression next week. This all stems from repeated social rejection from his peers. He lives with me again and now my mental health is taking a dive. I suddenly started having panic attacks last week after going years without them. Headaches every day. Just went to my NP today and discussed it. I’ve been holding it all in for months trying to be strong for my son. It felt good to tell someone that I’m not doing good.

When someone goes in their room and won’t speak it’s usually because they are angry upset or feel unheard, maybe listen to what he’s trying to say and just try to understand his feelings, stress and being unheard makes mental health issues far worse than they need to be, you’d be surprised what he might be able to do if he’s listened to and heard and appreciated.","It's not easy getting help from a mental health team I've been having trouble getting an appointment with them until now as I got hold of single point of access who got me the appointment, call ur doctor hun see wot they say if u can't get him to see a mental health team or if you live in the UK call or text single point of access like i did wen I had a breakdown last week i hope he gets the help that he needs."
How can you feel OK...then one little thing can make you feel sh#t all day !?? ..I'm in angry mode and it's awful ! 😖,Mnn,"It's not that one little thing can make you feel crap. It's that your holding up an unrealistic image of ""what you want to be"" and ""how you want it to be"" and if it's not met, which nothing ever really is for everyone, then you are disappointed. Just think about this, look at the way your acting ? Because things aren't meeting you requirements or expectancies?  Do you believe that everyone's requirements and expectancies are met on demand? You need to do as people do, and learn how to work with life. I'm only telling you this so that you can learn to be at peace. This is the way life works for everyone, but people learn how to remain neutral until something comes along and makes them happy then they can be happy while it lasts. No one's happy ALL of the time. Happiness is an emotion that comes and goes. It's contentment is what your looking for and everyone has, not happiness. When your content there's no need to yearn for happiness and sadness is not a factor because being happy is not obsessed over. So just learn how to be content and searching for happiness won't be an obsession. You can start by staying out of your mind. This is not to say the mind won't produce thoughts and keep going , but the less attention you pay to it the more it looses it's power and that power goes back to you. How do I know? Because obviously I've been there. Look up ""mindfulness"" and start practicing today. Your future self will be thankful."

"Just joined thank you,  my son is having a meltdown hitting him delft I have no idea what to do","My son wants to hurt himself, what do ido","It's possible that given an hour has passed, you've already done something. 
My suggestion would be first and foremost keep yourself safe. You cannot help your son if you're injured or hurt. So, you are a priority.
Secondly, if he has a treatment provider, or team contact them.
If not, start with a crisis line. They will be able to recommend a course of action for you.
Outside of all of this, if you think your son is at risk of harming himself or others, call an ambulance and or the police.
You can also let your son know that you can visually see that he's going through a really tough time. Ask him if there's anything he wants you to do to help. Be transparent, and use sensible boundaries, and let him know what help or support you're able to provide. 
Thoughts are with you. Sending hugs because I'm sure you could use one right now. 🤗🤗"

You carried or carry a lot, you took on too much responsibility etc = heavy laden.= heavy weight, feeling heavy etc..
Reading our system and working out when it became cross wired. Can’t change the past but we may be able to connect to our future by facing who we are, what we experienced and who we became in that process. Then heal, my only suggestion would be a Higher Loving Power who in those dark deep times can help lift us out when stuck in it.
Don’t do this on your own folks get a decent therapist to take on your journey of letting go."

"Saw numerous doctors, still nothing. Any advice here?

Hey guys and gals, I’m posting here as a last resort. This will be long. A few years ago, I started having short stabbing headaches. They occur in various places and typically last only a few minutes at a time. When they happen however, they really mess me up. It gives me brain fog, makes it hard to put words to together and focus, honestly feel like someone has a nerve tied up with a bread tie in my noggin’. I already suffer from anxiety and panic attacks so I felt like this was something else to add to it. They would happen randomly, at odd times with no immediate trigger.

I saw my doctor about it who initially showed concern and recommended I monitor it and if it got worse or continued, we’d get me setup with a neurologist. In the meantime, I was recovering from thyroid cancer with a partial thyroidectomy. A few months later I checked back in with my endo and he told me that my prolactin was high and my levels were off so he was concerned I had a prolactinoma. I went in for an MRI with contrast to focus on the pituitary and it came back as normal and nothing weird. So he recommended that I start taking a med to reduce the prolactin level, rather than correct the abnormal thyroid function. 

Fast forward to this year. January I started taking B6 to reduce the prolactin levels in my blood and I’ve yet to get updated blood work done with him. In july the headaches continued and my general doctor got me in with a neurologist who did a full brain MRI and they did a full work up of my brain. Results came back 100% clear. Normal brain, nothing weird anywhere. 

I just saw my doctor 3 weeks ago for an annual physical and the only abnormal levels were vitamin d. But I am recently vegetarian so it was expected. During all this I’ve been noticing that I will randomly get dizzy or light headed. I woke up the other morning and my right ear was ringing and had a full feeling. I will note that my allergies have been absolutely fucking insane this year. To add to all this I will occasionally get the sensation that my head, at least the back of it is in after. You know the feeling when you’re floating on the top of a pool with part of your body submerged? That. And it’s freaking me out. 

I’ve setup an appointment with an Ent late December but I am going mad. Multiple neuro visits, blood work, heart doctors even all telling me that my tests are showing absolutely nothing wrong with me. But these are real things that are happening to me. 

I’m not asking for medical advice, because I’ve saw at least 5-10 doctors. Literally at this moment my head is doing this thing, I’m light headed, hard to get a breath, brain fog, etc. my blood pressure is literally 120/80

Please help","I have recently been diagnosed with a mental health condition. I spent 2 weeks in hospital as they first suspected a stroke, had MRI & CT scans & CT Scan with contrasts, all clear. I am light sensitive to bright lights. I physically collapsed 2 weeks ago, had vertigo & right sided weakness, a few days later all my limbs went weak. My arms are now back to full strength although I do shake at times when I am anxious. My legs are still weak & have to walk with an aid. Never realised mental health can affect your physical health. Wish you support & understanding.","Jame Branton, have you seen a chiropractor? It could be something is pinched and you need an adjustment. They also can diagnose and see something that most medical doctors don't or wouldn't think about. Just something to think about. I have had great results with chiropractors. :)"
"What heals and helps me when my mental health is at its worst is making art and talking with Jesus.

I lost 25kg since 2017. I was not happy how I looked and felt. 
At first, I started eating clean Monday to Friday and gave myself treats at the weekend. Also, Started walking at least an hour a day. 
Whan I could see some progress I transitioned to ""Sunday funday"" and kept clean Monday to Saturday. ( Mentally it is easier to eat clean during the week knowing that I can treat myself on Sunday)
Also, I started running and going to the gym at least 4 days per week.
After 5 years I feel great and confident. 
It has become a lifestyle....

And how to increase and manage both.  I’m not qualified in that respect though exercise and good diet and restful sleep will help. 

But I can tell you from knowing the feeling of being lost, crying, feeling alone that you will see or feel moments when you have just enough to know you have a choice. In any one of those moments, wipe your tears.. take a breath, and then take several more. 

You are important. There are things you need to do. There are purposes that only you are designed for. And 
there is joy and happiness ready for you to fall in to.

Help me explain to my fiance that mental health issues can't just go away. That it's not something I can control.,"My dear sweet amazing husband was an addict, who had depression and anxiety and it was something we struggled through. However, he taught me that when you truly love someone even if you don't understand the problem or don't have that particular one doesn't mean you can't empathize to their pain. When you love them you stop and say simply I may not feel what your feeling but I can see it hurts. What can I do to help you? I'm still with you. Your not alone no matter what. You make the conscious decision everyday to make it work through the good and the bad for both of you. This is a life decision.",Lizzy Faye Seal I am sorry to hear you feel that but I am glad you felt comfortable sharing. Feel free to share more or to reach out in case you need someone to listen to you

I would say no matter the situation we are in, my advice is let’s try to give all pains and burdens to Him with our hearts today. We can’t understand yet everything in life but things can change in faith! Remember the suffering we have here is temporary and He promised to us Joy!!.. your life is worth and you are worth. There is no situation that can overcome us. Welcoming Jesus in hearts doesn’t mean problems disappear but can be faced with the strenght needed",Love and positive vibes coming your way ♥️..dig deep.. stay strong ..💙..hope you are ok man ✌x

,"I went to work  but thankfully, it was a much more peaceful day. I hope it continues as such during this ""lockdown""","Made the mistake of eating white rice yesterday. Today I paid the price with stomach pain today, I will learn 🤦‍♀️"
Having mental health issues like depression can make you feel weak and worthless. But every single night you go to bed and go to sleep.. is another night you beat your mental health. It didn't take you. Keep taking each day as it comes and keep winning 💙 you're so much stronger than you realise.,"So true, a new perspective for me, thank you","Majority of mental health issues are caused because we as humans complicate things. Mother nature provided all we need but we had to go and make a man made system for everyone to live by and if you don't conform they lock you in a box. The stress of that alone is enough to give you a mental breakdown, look around, everyone you know has had one at some point"
"I feel that I'm suffering a bit with my mental health. I'm married and have a couple of step children. I have a decent enough job I think. 

It's my marriage what I'm struggling with the most. I feel like my wife doesn't love me as much as she used to and that she's really ashamed of me. I must admit I have got comfortable with marred life and probably let myself go a bit. I feel ashamed in myself by the way I look and it's starting to get me really down. To the point where I'm thinking of letting my wife go so she can go be happy with somebody better looking and a better body and everything. 

I really have Fallen out of love with myself and they say you can't love anyone else until you love yourself. I feel I don't have anyone to talk to about my situation including my wife. She would just laugh it off. Has anyone got any advice of what I can do because there is a lot going on in my head right now and it hurts",Im in same position as yourself but im the woman xx,"Make a list of what you feel would make you happy and go through that list one by one. 
I always find getting my hair done makes me feel more confident about myself. 
Finally talk to someone and your wife of course 🙏🏻"

"Hi everyone, new to the site. Just lately I can not stop crying. Been to doc, talk about anti depression tablets but trying to stay off them. Any suggestions pls x","Not started them, spoke to doc said may feel worse before have any effect. Don't want to feel worse than I am already feeling.","Many thanks to everyone, had a lovely walk today with dog. She is in foster care at the moment hoping to find a place together. My ex partner thru me out on the streets and then my dog. Took me ten days to find her. It totally messed me up. Never felt so low. But today we both enjoyed the walk. Thanks again."
"Can anybody give advice, my brother lives in supported living and has recieved inheritance money, looking for the best place to put it so it doesnt hinder were he is unsure about trust funds.","He needs to disclose it if he's getting benefits, I wouldn't know where to put it, but also there's a lot more to it than that, does he have capacity to understand about money? Has he had a mental capacity assessment if so and he hasn't capacity who looks after his finances. If its not you or any immediate family you have to give it to them or you could be potentially charged with financial abuse, its so much harder when your in supported living or being cared for. I hope this helps you, but I wouldn't know where to invest it","Maybe basic savings, if he has a preferred bank Maybe book appointment and have an meeting together if possible."
I come home from voluntary work to find out that I just had a nasty message from somebody that's supposed to be my friend accusing me of something I haven't even done I'll try my best to do everything for anybody I try my best to help people as best as I can and all I seem to get is shit I really don't know how much longer I can go on like this because I'm coming to the point where I can't cope anymore you're very suicidal tonight I don't know what to do,Maybe it’s time to separate she may have some things that she needs to work on that has nothing to do with you you can’t fix the situation especially if she doesn’t think she is the one that may need the help,Maybe it's time to let go of that friend real friends wouldn't do that
"I feel all alone like I can’t talk to anyone, not even my wife. Just feel like a man servant! I mise well be alone I think it is there I may be able to find true happiness! Everyone in this world is so full of shtt!",,Maybe there is a men only mental health support group in your area that could be beneficial to you?
Does anyone feel lonely and fear that people don’t wanna chat to you if they leave you on read or don’t respond to you for ages whereas previously they message you often? Just wondering how to break this cycle as thinking people are just busy isn’t helping 😞,"I'm not sure if this is exactly the same, but I used to believe that no one liked me...from the Receptionist at my Drs surgery, to my colleagues at work, to the people I was friends with, even my own family.

It was a sad and lonely place to be and it ate away at my self-worth till there was almost nothing left.

In one of the therapy groups I did, I learned how to be curious. 

How there might be a view different from my own. How I may have been making assumptions. 

And the purpose wasn't to find out the truth or reality, because sometimes we can't, the point was to simply be curious about alternative explanations.","Maybe they are dealing with there own things or they busy at work or there life, it doesn't mena they dont care or dont want to listen, just a case of not available at the time"
Are there any numbers I can call to chat to someone im totally isolated & alone things are so bad atm in a very dark place!,"Try googling the Samaritans number. They are the best to contact. Please hold on, your dark days won't last forever. I've been to hell and back again many times, you are not alone xxxx ❤❤❤","Maybe time to go right back to basics. Get outside in the brightest time of the day, walk, exercise if you can, eat healthy no junk, v low booze snd no drugs. Try and find the nearest key line to you snd go abs sit near it and soak up the energy. The meds and everything are great but the healing starts deep in the heart, one step at a time. Make a positive thought and your mind will double it, you’ve got this babes xx"

"So my best friend and kids God father just recently passed. He was my 7 year old son’s best friend. My son is usually a happy and chipper care free kid but now he’s just always sad. I barely know how to help my self through this tough time and I’m barely holding on. Any tips on how to help him or even what to say when he breaks down. We have good and bad days, today was a bad one.","I'm sorry for you loss, he seemed to have been a fine person leaving such an impression.
Children grieve as strongly as adults but it's even worse for them because it also raises so many existential thoughts and fears. Could this happen to mommy? To me? Talking about death, about his godfather, about his feelings is really important. Be honest but reassuring. Children know when adults lie and it makes them even more unsafe. Yes, we all can die but we'll do anything to be safe. Celebrate and make his godfather a presence and help him to connect to the love he gave him.  And above all give him tons of love, cuddles, patience and presence. He needs every single person that can be there for him. Be patient, he will go through it but it might be a rough ride. He might be angry, resentful and withdrawn. Healing takes time. If you have access to good grief counseling or grief groups for kids it's also very good.",Memory boxes are a wonderful way to remember and to share your thoughts and feelings about your loved one passing with each other as well as privately. They do a great job in helping the process without forcing anything
I need a bit of advice I have been with a partner for years  who has been physically violent few times and verbally abusive a lot. We split up but he’s trying to win me back part of me still loves him and wants to try again but another part of me is struggling to move passed what he put me through and been grieving for a while to so my head is a mess and have no idea how to get my head straight to make proper decision and be strong enough to stick to it,I’m an amputee from domestic violence count your blessings and don’t take him  back my love x,Men never change. They turn on the charm to get what they want which is to bully you and your children. Find a man that is genuine and who is loyal to you. There's a lot about. Your partner probably has a few women on the go. Don't wait until you hate him and it's too late
"Some people have a Mental illness there is still a stigma towards
the illness we did not ask for it we do not want it we need help for it the healthcare should do more research. I suffer from Mental illness all my life a lot of people think we are completely crazy and violent.

Hi. Well this is weird. I have recently been diagnosed with bi polar. About four months ago I had a manic episode and left the family home and moved away. Well three months later I’m back at home and with the family support and hopefully some counselling (currently 6 monthly waiting list) I hope that I will be ok. Not sure if I will ever be the old me but maybe a better one!,https://welleq.com/,"Mental health can be challenging. But with the right support and tools you will do fine. If you feel you need a counselor sooner than 6 months, you might look into telehealth. There you can be seen right away if need be. And some insurance companies cover that now."

"So here’s some words about my life, I’m 46 and I wana fukin die
Trapped in this house it’s fukin day n nyt 
Made an orphan and not my fukin choice
It all started wen I was 10 yrs old, was I fukin cold wen under his sheets I was told 
It’s his dick I had to hold
Why the Fuk did he do that shit
Dint ya think wen I’m older it was gona Fuk up shit?
Now I wait for death cuz that’s the only peace
Fuk, I’d blow my fukin brains if I had a fukin piece 
Now I’m on my own yea  they all left
Cuz everything I owns in box to my left
The rich stay rich and the poor die young
To Fuk off all the pain I gota smoke up all my lungs
Got 3 kids,baby dads are bums
Both fuked off to hide behind their mums
I curse u motherfukas until the day I die
I’m gona fukin haunt ya right down from the fukin sky
Yous hurt my fukin heart now there’s a story to be told
The story bout Angie, her heart you could never hold 
Yea I kept ya kids alive yea I won this shit
Get called a slag for fukin wat
It’s my fukin wrists I wana fukin slit
Not a day I don’t think bout my mom
She dint grow me to be in this kinda slum
I was doin well before I met that prick
Run to the feds , Fuk I felt a snitch 
But to save my life I had to fukin switch
Yea as women we can see it thru
But wat da Fuk did I do to u??
So now I’m sitting here on my fukin own
Got one more kid that I gota grow
Couldn’t take my life if I wanted to
Gota see it thru for my little boo
Feel so blessed with my grandson 
Say ya fukin prayers can I have some!
Wear the fukin cross my momma gave me
Don’t know why but it’s brings tranquility 
Tranquility is all I need
Wana go swim in the deep blue seas
But them flights, they ain’t fukin free
Ain’t been nowhere in 20 yrs
But my fam , yea they fly yea here n there
Ain’t got a care, Naa they wasn’t there
Don’t give a Fuk if we starve to death
Sleep in m&s wen they go to bed
Fuk them frauds I’ve fukin had enough 
They ain’t lived me I’ve had it fukin tough
If I had a fukin gun 
I’d smoke them in a puff
So I’ll rate me, cuz I’m a diamond in the rough

"I need some help/advice...I weaned off my Sertraline/Zoloft (too quickly) about 2 weeks ago. 

For the last few nights I've experienced an intense rush of anxiety/panic while trying to fall asleep. It feels like I'm going to stop breathing and die. I force myself awake/out of the pre-sleep state and feel relieved that I was able to do so. 

Has anyone else experienced this severe panic while drifting off to sleep after ceasing an antidepressant? How long did it last? Did anything help?  I've been forcing myself to stay awake because of how scared I am to experience it again but this is not sustainable. 

I'm waiting for a call-back from my doctor, but hoping for some advice in the meantime.

          XXXXXXXXXX","You need to find a way to stop the pattern of your brains signal to anything negative. What helps me is the 5 second rule. Every time you catch yourself having a negative thought or feeling an anxiety attack is coming on just take stop, take a deep breath, then count 5,4,3,2,1... then immediately think of something positive or something that makes you feel good even if you have to force yourself. Just keep doing this 100x a day if you have to. This interrupts the brains association to negativity that ultimately results in stress and anxiety. You are rewiring your brain. This technique has really helped me reduce all the negativity that circles in my head. Hope this helps. =)",Mindful meditation is wonderful and listening to ambient music can be very soothing

"Update update. We got him to the hospital and convinced him to sign in.  
They are now holding him. Running test. Some kind of psychotic break. He’s the sweetest young man ♥️

Update.  He just told his mom that he thinks he is god.  We are rushing over there. I’ve got crisis numbers pulled up on my phone. 

Hi!  Totally new here.  I am looking for some suggestions.  My step son, age 26, has always been an introvert.  He fell into a failure to launch pattern.   For the last 5 years or so, he’s worked and stayed home, not much of a social life.  I feel like he suffers from depression and anxiety for sure.  He’s been on meds, but hasn’t taken them in a while.  
SO the reason I’m here, in the last week he has exhibited ￼very manic behavior.  All very overly positive, my eyes have been opened, I see my path (but can’t define a path), all very non-specific motivational poster type comments.  It is a very sudden departure from his normal personality.  

I told his dad I see lots of 🚩🚩 and that he might be having a mental crisis.  

Thoughts? Advice?","If you are able to have a conversation with your step son and just talk about things in general, e.g what he watches, listens to, likes to read etc and let him tell tell you what his things are. Don't go straight in and ask him about mental health issues etc, build up to it. Let him gain trust in you and he will talk in his own time. When he does talk about things, let him talk and don't interrupt him at any point or say he's wrong for how he feels. There is no right or wrong on how people feel.",Miranda Welch Stockhausen  have you thought of taking him to see a doctor?
"Hi everyone,

I'm sorry to bother you, but lately I've been struggling with my schoolwork in college. In my first year, I was doing exceptionally well, getting As and passing all of my classes. 

But this year, I've been failing miserably in a lot of my classes. The thing is I'm trying to do some inner child work and working through childhood trauma. But it seems to be affecting my motivation and discipline. It's not the same as it was in first year. I went to see the college counsellor, but I left them because they We're incredibly invalidating.

Now I'm scared that I'll lose the privilege of going to college and I'll lose my scholarship.

But at the same time, I was also thinking of taking a leave of absence to prioritize my mental health. I've thought of the consequences, but I'm still wary.

Any thoughts?","Hello, I’m sorry to hear about your childhood trauma, I really am, but it depends how much you want this? You are clearly capable of doing this because you’ve got As and passed all your classes before, Why can’t you do it again??","Mixed feeling.  Part of me says focus on school and finish it.
But mental health and healing is important.
Sometimes it hard to get back to school.

I cannot talk to anyone, all they do is judge and then talk about me behind my back as if I’m not there or can’t hear them. I here the whispers. All of them.So now, I put a smile on my face and pretend everything is fine. I’m so tired of wearing this mask. I just need to get this of my chest… Holding it in is just making it worse.","You have made the first step and admitted you are struggling and need some advice and help. You need to speak to people you can trust and will not judge you, because no one has the right to judge you, nearly everyone is going through this difficult time so you are not alone, just take one day at a time and really think about your budget and how to squeeze the most out off those pennies. Xx","Most people are struggling and just doing what they can to get by. Graceful as a Swan gliding across the water but underneath feet are paddling like crazy just to stay afloat.
As for people talking behind your back,  this happens all the time but when we are happy we don't notice.
You cannot cope alone, you need to share your worries and ask for help. X"
"1 other sad thing is that's true is females get supported alot more than men as I've seen it so much they get emotional support and care and love more and all my life I've suffered all the so many things I've gone through alone always been abandoned and left behind wish I could get support to its not fair that so many men don't get support like alot of women do they are so much more supported in comparison as I've seen it for myself I would just like that support to because we are just as important well should be and I've never felt important or truly cared for and not had the love in my life

It's sad that il probably never get a support system actually is very sad wish I had people there for me anytime and don't mean online hate being so alone in my suffering mental health and loneliness 💔🤕",Don't expect too much from other people. Just be kind and friendly. You don't know the problems other people have. Don't sacrifice yourself. Equal rights,"Most people have too much on their plate too and that's why they can't handle supporting somebody else. See it this way, and you will change your perception towards other people and be less disappointed. That was my way of thinking and it helped me so much. Something else, what help do you crave exactly? Would you like to share? I am here for you and to listen to your struggles, but you have to be willing to open up to me and if you do, I can give you some feedback and support too. Hope to hear from you soon. Blessings!"

"TW ❗️hi everyone. I am 15 and This may be a long post so feel free to just skip if you would like. I would like some advice or support etc for my mental health as I have been monitoring my mh for over a year and overtime it has gradually gotten worse. I'm staying home alot more I'm becoming more physical with things like doors ( punching holes ) and walls such as headbanging when I'm angry. My anxiety has reached the roof. I have an issue where I pinch my face when angry or nervous or upset. I have only seen 1 doctor in the past about this where I was diagnosed with a ""mild tic"" but I refuse to believe that that is what it is as I can restrain it. I pinch my face constantly sometimes even just randomly no matter the mood and overtime it hasn't bruised my face much, I'll pinch it very hard but no bruising really appears which in a way makes me upset because it makes me feel like I haven't accomplished hurting myself? It may be hard to understand but I just need support as I'm too anxious to speak up to my parents or school and it leads to suicidal thoughts. I stay awake into the early hours of the morning with a lighter just hurting my arm because of how miserable I am and I sometimes wonder if I'm overthinking it like I could be fine and instead just having a bad day you know? But it is like this Everyday. I'm sorry for the long enquiry and thank you for taking the time to read. Any advice or such is appreciated x","Show this to your mum and dad and the doctor. Keep pestering them. You need help and some counselling may help.

My mental heath is getting worse I feel so alone all the time worrying about my mental health getting out of control again,"Same, I seem to have had a relapse and gone backwards!","My dear Joey, permit me to address this issue from the root cause. You must first realize that you are a wonderful person that has the full right to be joyful. Secondly, you are allowing your body to dance to the tune of that your thought pattern is playing for you. Your present thoughts are as a result of circumstances and situations that have played out in your life before now, and apparently, those circumstances and situations were ugly, so the thoughts they formed in your subconsciousness are ugly. It is these unpalatable and depressive thoughts that your mind is presently dwelling on and causing you to feel this negativity you are presently feeling. 
My joy is that, I can authoritatively tell you that in that your same mind is domiciled the power that you require to turn the ugly condition around and create your joy! In your mind lies your solution!! Believe me, joy, happiness and peace are right there in your hands waiting eagerly for you to claim and possess them. Just try out these few steps to start with:
1. Loud Verbal Declaration: When you wake up every morning, stand in front of your mirror and declare audibly ""I AM A WONDERFUL CREATION OF GOD AND I AM CREATED TO BE JOYFUL, AND ENJOY PEACE FROM WITHIN. THERE IS NO SPACE FOR DEPRESSIVE THOUGHTS IN MY MIND""
""I SEND EVERY NEGATIVE ENERGY AND THOUGHTS OUT OF MY MIND NOW"" ""TODAY I SHALL BE HAPPY, JOYFUL AND FRUITFUL""
Declare this for about 2 or 3 times with a smile on your face.
2. Music: Search out the songs that bring you joy and affect your mood positively whenever you play them. You can play them and sing along. 
3, Deep Breathing exercises: As many times as possible during the day, do a deep breathing exercise by breathing in deeply and breathing out completely. 
4. Carefully select the kind of thoughts you allow into your imagination and mind and watch what you unknowingly or knowingly meditate on. Disallow every thought that have a negative coloration. For no reason must you let negative thoughts take root in your heart. Weed them out as soon as they come into you. 
Our thoughts are the seeds for our joy or sadness.
5. Make sure you make someone, at least one person happy (either by giving them something or helping them out even in the smallest way) Smile a lot at people when you greet them.
Enjoy peace and joy."
"TW : abortion and suicide LONG POST

I’m literally so sad I’m trying to not cry . I am a single mom . I signed up for this . I chose the wrong guy to sleep with and I stopped talking to him because he made me feel worthless . He only wanted the baby and me pay him child support while he takes care of the kid or I get an abortion .. sometimes I think I should have gotten one . I love my baby but I have several issues if my own . But without my kid I probably would have k.myself !! And I tried to do everything I was so miserable.. I tried talking to people , therapy , meds , hanging out with people . It was a really dark time for me and when I found out I was pregnant and kid came I felt like I needed to keep going .. but I don’t really have much help . My kid is 1 and has spent the night over someone house once . It’s always me and my kid . I don’t really have friends even though I try ..  I suffer from depression and anxiety still . I just dont know what to do . I’m starting to feel helpless again and I have thoughts of giving my kid up for adoption . But I love my kid and I don’t think I could live with myself so I’m pretty much stuck . And people makes you feel awful for being a single mom . I just can’t 😔","Awww. You definitely need support even if that's in the form of support groups. Yes it's hard to not have family and friends but what I've learned is that if those things are not available then find secondary sources that can help even if they are not as great as true family or true friends.         My suggestions are: Library-- there are usually free kids events that can just bring you and your little a sense of community. The librarians are usually always helpful and leading so that makes anxiety lessen. The more you go the more comfortable you'll be there.        In person support groups-- even though these people might never be your best friend, there is something about hearing others, interacting with others, and having a safe place to breathe. You are not alone and support groups help you really understand that.         County Community Services--- This I recommend not for the general mental health, but  ask to have a case worker. It's all free and they help with finding programs in your community for your specific case. They can help you with child care options so you can go to support groups, there are also in home parenting mentorships and also early preventative childhood programs where you take your child to play with other children.           I think you are a wonderful person to have chosen life and that little child you are responsible for is definitely blessed to have you. Many prayers and well wishes. I hope this gave you some hope to push forward and find support to pull you through.",My dear you are a beautiful wonderful person and a loving Mother. Your baby loves you and needs you. Get all the help you can. Doctor health visitor Mother and baby group. You will be surprised how many people will understand your feelings. You are brave and strong. You will overcome all this.

With that said, once you can see that not all people can or know how to handle homosexuality or transsexuality you might want to choose to share it with those that will lift you up and support you. Your sexuality and gender orientation is yours and you are not obliged to share it or talk about it with everyone. Find people who can, and will support you and focus on being true to yourself. Fighting for validation from people who can't or won't give it to you will only make you miserable and you, like every human being, deserve to be happy. Live, love and explore.

His mood goes from decent to serious like a flip of a switch. Something simple turns into a big deal and even when you think he's over it, he will still complain about it again another day. He uses retail therapy and even that only works for a short amount of time. Any advice? Thank you","The good news for your partner is that if he doesn't need them, time will soon tell.

"Today I feel hopless and sad my head is just noise like a million and 1 thoughts I can't seem to get my mind organised im trying to read self help books, meditate and to try and organise myself but im finding it impossible. I feel helpless, lost, afraid with no motivation to do anything I just want to cry but can't I need to escape from life. I have no friends im always alone I isolate from the world I have no energy and im full of hate, anger, resentment, negativity I think mainly at myself I have no love inside I feel numb to my soul if this is life then I don't want it anymore I just want quiet peace and darkness",I will stop and sit with you as I know this all to well. I'm an expert in this. Not in the remedy but in the struggle. No one understood in my mind because that's how it feels and that's the truth until you realise and see that many people do understand. The day I realised and very recently that I'm not the only one and that all that anger hate frustration and resentment was actually the actual culprit in blocking my vision and sight and stopping me from seeing this. keeping me feeling isolated and cut off from the world around me or and god. That was the day of releasing baggage. I can confidently tell you that you are not alone and all you have to do is believe that and see it for yourself. I cannot do it for you but I promise you that there's alot out there waiting for you if only you would lower your guards and your walls and allow for yourself to see this and allow the light to come in. I felt cursed and abandoned I felt hatred rejection misfit pushed out black sheep and I held it all inside and it raged on and on until I said ok I'm tired I'm exhausted. I want to be loved I want to feel something again. I want connection again and I want to feel freedom again I want love I want peace I want happiness 😢 and sure enough when you want it it will come. You begin to thaw out and life begins to beat again yet life needs a chance too. Feed it love and tenderness. Then wait for the magic. Yours sincerely.,Negative thoughts and depression go round and round. You can only do your best. Make little steps towards a positive life. When you know your own worth you will have friends. Be positive with your friends. Look in the mirror and smile. You are a wonderful amazing person
"I felt so lonely after being treated badly by someone, hoping that things may be better if I tried to patch up things and give them another chance. I should have known it wouldn't work as now I've seen all the nasty ways they have, I'm noticing more. Not the best idea. I really want it to work because there were some positives.",No positives. Charm is deceptive,Never chase someone to be in your life.  Sounds like the negatives outweigh the positives!  Your self worth matters more.

"Hi, I just found this group. I am
 44 years old and have been diagnosed with sooooo many disorders. 4 years ago I met a psychiatrist that I really clicked with. He diagnosed me with 6 different things, alot due to all the severe abuse from my past. Due to whatever,  all the psychiatrist were let go and the RN'S took over, which caused me to leave
 The next psychiatrist I found diagnosed me me with another disorder ontop of the other 6. I definitely looked at myself as damaged goods. Well a month ago I finally found my 1st psychiatrist, had 2 visits with him..low and behold he tacked another diagnosis onto me..yeah I'm a hot mess..all mainly caused by all the abuse I went thru...I have tried soooo many meds..they either don't work or cause me to feel out of it the next day..I haven't slept thru the night in a lil more than 3 years. Have tried 4 different sleep meds. They might help me fall asleep but I'm up like like always 2 hours later and feel groggy and drugged the.next day. I'm sooo over it. Very discouraged which makes me not want to see the doc anymore..to just give up!! Has anybody else been in this situation?if so what do you do???  I'm over the doctors as well as all the meds!!!",Sending love and hugs darling ❤️❤️🤗🤗,"Never stop fighting for your mental health. You are worth it.

"Has anyone else experienced anything similar and how did you over come it xxx

I kinda feel lost. I was in a relationship for 6 years we've been split up a year. I new the relationship we had was tough and that I had gone through things I shouldn't of. But after talking to a therapist, she's now pointing out that it was domestic abuse. I guess because he never hit me I didn't see it like that. It kinda makes sense now that I'm talking through it but how do I over come it. How do I find myself again. X","I’m sorry you went through this, I’ve been in a similar situation and I can honestly say the only thing that has helped me is time, time to reflect and heal, and someone to talk through things with. It’s good that you’re getting counselling, just take one step at a time and give yourself time to heal xx","No contact with the person at all helps you focus on you more. 
Then you have time to begin remembering who you are again.

My mum cares for me as best as she can but she’s emotionally unavailable and very self centred / borderline narcissistic . I’m dealing with depression all on my own with a few distant friends. I have come to realise that I may also be a bit of a narcissist and struggle in conversation about mundane things. I’m leaning on my faith to give me strength and guidance which is Islam. Has anyone else seen narcissistic traits in themselves and overcome it. How do you change your lack of attention to / interest in others. It’s lonely having little interest in things and being so self-cantered.,You start by being mindful of your actions. Search for videos of Dr. Ramani on youtube. She's the expert on narcissism. I'm sure you'll find the answers you need.,"Not being able to focus on conversations can also be a symptom of other things like anxiety or ADHD etc. I wrote a book about anxiety. It’s easy to read and allows the reader to apply the information personally. It’s called Not Good Enough: Understanding your Core Belief and Anxiety and is available on Amazon.

However she was basically my only friend. I have a 23-year-old son who lives with me but he's away for the summer. I don't work, and I don't have a car at the moment.

"Hello! Posting for a friend who is not on Facebook. My brothers friend has issues with restlessness, high anxiety, agitation and sometimes sudden bursts of agression. Once the burst is over he falls in a “vacuum” of down emotions. Also, he, sometimes has unexpected feeling of sadness. He can be sitting down and talking to someone and then suddenly he experiences a deep feeling of sadness, for no reason. Then he jumps back to normal. He says it’s like the bursts overtake him and they are extremely difficult to manage. Now he went into therapy. He really wants to “fix” this and manage. If possible. He recently read that irritation, sudden mood changes can be also caused by a thyroid gland and/or can be related to kidneys as well? Is that possible? If so, what can he check? 

Any advice would be appreciated!

He was like this since he is a teen, he is 31 now. As a kid he had issues with concentration as well.","PTSD, Anxiety, complex trauma, and depression has been impairing a lot of people around the world and researchers have proven that mind manifestation (microdosing) has been of great help to us, I was struggling for years but now I'm more creative and productive.

"I'm looking for some advice for UK. I have suffered lot of abuse from my wife and have been blackmailed which is getting worse.

If she wants anything done or gets angry on anything then she will ask for divorce and tell me she will take kids away which are all under age of 10. I'm very attached to kids and she knows it's my weakness and I continue to obey her for sake of my kids who will be destroyed.

If I argue,c stand up then she will simply say give me divorce and I'm going to destroy all you have so I get scared.

It does not matter how much I make her happy or do for her, if I don't or can't do something she wants then she will threaten me, stop being normal and will demand divorce every time.

I have a house on mortgage which I pay, my name and have some good savings.

Is there any way I can protect the house such as putting it in trust on my kids name so in event of divorce it stays with kids?

Is there any way I can protect my savings such as deposit in another country where UK has no rights to access that money?

Can she take kids out of UK and settle back home without my permission? She is very greedy and her family are happy for her to leave me and get all money and move back so they can all take advantage of me. I can't see my kids settling out of UK in third world country and it hurts me to even think about this.

Thank you.",A lot of people think only woman suffer I lot of men are out there quietly suffering in silence well done for speaking out I hope you get some help 🥰🥰🥰,Omg i feel for you some people dont deserve kids. You sound a good man go seek a good solicitor fight for whats yours xxx

I want to find happiness and peace to cure my depression and anxiety but I don’t know how to find that happiness. I love my family and friends so much but I feel like I’m always bringing them down on top of their own problems. I’m just sick of everything at the moment tbh. Sorry just needed to vent a little.,Happy birthday 😊,"One a verry happy birthday, you love your family and friends ; they love you too.  Could you start with one saying how you feel. You are loved but understand your looking for something else so start st the start xxxxxxx"

Hi is this  just public to the group or is it on the full fb page,It’s a public group so is visible to all unless posting anonymously,One of my posts git sent to my fb page so all frinds list could read it i was very annoyed as it then caused evdn more problems.
What's the remedy for mental health,"There are different remedies for different challenges within the mental health sphere, what is currently your biggest challenge?","Only when we understand we are NOT the mind, can we overcome MH. I can walk anyone through this."
"Hello I am new to the group, I have just experienced an 'episode' however I'm not sure what it was. 

I don't know if it was a panic or anxiety attack or if I'm having some sort of mental breakdown.

I am super stressed and in a situation that I don't know how to fix or what to do, it's literally driving me insane. 

I couldn't stop crying and couldn't breathe, I got pins and needles in my ears, hands and feet, I couldn't see straight, felt sick, dizzy and cold and was hyperventilating through crying. Then my fingers froze completely, I couldn't even use or hold my phone, had to lie on the floor. 

Whole episode lasted about 40 minutes and it was so scary

I've never had one and anything like this before. 

Wondering if anyone can help me understand what happened",I don no but pls go to er rt away,Panic attack
Nobody ever asks if I'm OK. Everyone judges me and doesn't see the real me.,if your names not up no one can check on you dear,Peace 🙏
Hi. Just wanted to wish everyone peace for the holidays ⭐️🙏,"Happy peaceful days for you
also.🕊",Peace and joy to you
"Your smile is also a hope for someone. Keep smiling, it will make you beautiful and someone else hopeful.
Love and best wishes 
XX",Wise words,"People always say I'm smiley,sometimes I don't realise that I am. I  do get down but really try to find the positive and push it to one side , try not to let everything get you down at once. Loneliness is probably the worst so when I'm with others,easier to smile."
"Iam feeling so defeated. I have been trying to get my husband the help that he needs, and it’s gone downhill all over again. Background information on us we have been together since he was 18 and I was 19 I am 40 now we have three children together and married. He was in counseling for his addictions to drinking excessive alcohol, and having sex with other women. But today I had enough. I hurt and can’t do this anymore. He said he would stop and he purposely texted another person who I thought was a friend of mine but I guess I am wrong. They exchanged pictures and sex texts and he hides them from me but I kinda knew because his behavior changed. Then he broke down and told me after I found the texts and he don’t want me to leave. Idk what to do now. This isn’t the first time either. 😭😭😭😭",Only u can decide when you have had enough. If and when that day comes u will leave and not look back or ask for advice. You can have all the advice in the world but u have to make that decision. I'm sorry you are going through this.,"People can change, but it takes work and a true desire to do so. He won’t just wake up different one day. If you don’t see any work on his part, such as counseling or AA classes, I would run and don’t look back. He honestly sounds like a narcissist. Sorry about your situation, but you deserve so much better and that starts with loving and honoring yourself."
"I'm so sick of when I'm explaining my mental health issues it's always dismissed as ""oh you just want attention"" ""oh look this person right here is crazy"" like. Why does no one have the respect or decency to not say this type of shit to someone who's struggling mentally when you know it may effect them.","There's so much push back from people these days whenever mental health issues and problems are shared. I'm very careful whom I disclose my issues with. Mainly because some people are ignorant and lack compassion and empathy. It is sad and frustrating. The world isn't as beautiful as its sometimes made out to be. But we can control, somewhat, the environment we surround ourselves in. I'm sorry you experienced that. People really don't deserve this kind of judging. We are all suffering in some way, we're all just trying to get by as best as we can ❤️","People don’t understand the use of words . Once you say something horrible, hurtful, you can’t take it back . Then it’s stuck in your mind and it’s going round and round x"
"After a long day when you get home, what's the best way to make you relax? Should I make you tea, hug you, pour you a bath, serve a glass of wine, have dinner ready? What really works?","Everyone has a love language, 😊","People need their own space to relax, so having your own emotions grounded would help, over giving stresses. Then being aware of the daily tasks that they would usually have to do that takes their time and have those done"
It’s best if I keep my feelings to myself because talking about it will just make me more irritable due to the fact that people will just give me unhelpful advice and sometimes will appear rude and condescending.,"Can relate to that.
Even my own sister 
She doesn't  understand  aniexty. 
She makes me feel worse.",People often just don’t get it. They mean to be helpful but can be the complete opposite. Just remember you are stronger than you think and every day is a win 💪🏻
"They’re scared to let you fly because the higher you go, the smaller they look. Surround yourself with people who want to fly with you. ❤️",Sending love ❤️ Having Positivi-tea everyday helps. 🙂,Perfectly said!
Hello my old friend has gone mad he thinks he's jesus etc any advice everyone has had a go but he thinks theres nothing wrong  bit worried about it vas he's getting worse now storming into police stations ordering them to stand down,Trying to get him to come with me to a mental health place to be assessed Thankyou  I will keep at it,"Perhaps go along …. Try asking him to turn water into wine, the Lord’s first miracle."
Why do I feel like I'm not making progress with whatever I do?,"I’ve felt the same way for a while, during my high school years. You are loved! God is with you! 🙏🙏",Perhaps you should seek to simply try to experience life without measuring yourself so often as to what you deem as progress?
"Need someone to talk to, struggling with my mental health.",Hi I'm not the best but I'm here,person to person is far better
Hello everyone I’m new here but I have a bad childhood my last marriage I was manipulated and put down. I decided to get a dog and that was a bad idea cus all the mental abuse I grew up with and my marriage. Im with someone now I really care about and they treat me well and like I human which im still scared to real let go cus my past and im scared to screw this relationship up. I want a dog again but I don’t know mental if im ready if that makes sense,Well done on being in a good relationship. A dog is for life quite long time so I would think carefully about it. You havnt said if u r living with new partner so I assume you'd both need agree to having a dog if living together.,Pets do help sometimes
"And so my time wasting in life, just goes on. I seem to spend so much time on social media. That it's just addictive. So much so, that I've allowed it to disrupt my body clock. I get so engrossed with chatting on Facebook messenger, that it's dominating my life. So, when nobody responses to me. I just sulk like a immature spoilt inner child that I'm still dealing with. I spend all my time being alone. That can cause the occasional low feeling of being isolated. I am trying to arrange on Facebook friend and dating groups to meet up with someone. But that's not going well. I come a few who say that they wanna meet up. But they just don't seem to be all that keen to do so. 

Realistically, I know I need to join social groups. But I have social anxiety and I find it hard to approach people and strike up a conversation with them. I need to make a effort to attend these sort of social groups. But I'm lazy and I can't be bothered to plan something. Ugh, I'm so bored at the moment. I wish I could change the way I live my boring life. Being sleep deprived doesn't exactly help as it effects my energy levels and all I do is spend the majority of time. Is sitting on fat lazy backside and navigating around on my phone. I'm so addicted to it. What a waste of a life, I live. Sorry, I'm cynical but I am just so clueless on how to live a fulfilled proactive life. 

Wishing all of you. Good mental health.","Start small.  U need to do activities that make you feel good.  Don't think about relationships self care and getting out the house r main things. You can't meet people stuck in your house. You can succeed. You can have a happy life. You can find someone you like. You r in charge of your life David. You have to find your inner strength and say I am going to be happy

Every time I see your posts I can see your hurt and despair and just want to say there r people out there that can identify with that and can be supportive of your struggles.  

There will be setbacks as always in life . That's how you learn. Move on change your habits change your views. Ok I believe you want this on your heart. Plan it. Do it ok",Phones have ruined people's lives. People r dependant on them putting filters on making them look different etc. Story reels etc. It's not what life is really about.  To me it's nature. Outside beauty of seasons. Beauty of love beauty of making own decisions. Beauty of not caring what people say do or put on social media.  Honestly ditch your phone

"Ive been struggling with my mental health for months.
I had bad anxiety back in February and i thought it had gone, but the last few weeks i can barely  concentrate, im really stressed and i cry a lot.
Im also struggling to sleep so im exhausted.
I dont really have anyone to talk to as i have difficulty talking to people
Im afraid to go to my gp as im afraid ill be signed off/ given meds
I can't afford to be signed off and i need the routine of work
my learning difficulties make taking meds regularly difficult

I broke down last night and finally admitted to my mom that Im an alcoholic.  I've had such depression and such anger over my teeth and life that I've used alcohol as my crutch always giving myself excuses of why I should drink then I get mad at myself for doing it. I not only need to stop but really do want to stop. I know I've been deliberately slowly hurting myself and it really has hurt me more mentally. I want to do better and be better and stop giving in to my emotions. I will be honest I am struggling in this world of ours it's straight making me angry and I'm constantly at a loss of how to make it through.  I don't think any of us asked for all this pain and hardship.  I'm honestly tired of just surviving always surviving.  I want peace so bad I want to live...so question is where I start for nothing is going to change in my life but yet I need to change myself not for the worst but for the better. Blessed Be to all,Well wishes,"Please go and get help
for your addiction. No matter what the cost is, 
try hypnotherapy, pay to see a therapist or someone that will help you straight away, do not rely on an appointment from your doctor that can take weeks or months. 
Alcohol is the biggest depressive and is not the answer to anyone’s problems. I have been breaking my heart today as I have just lost someone this morning because of Alcohol. Be strong, you are stronger than you think, you have recognised you have an issue with it so now is the time to take control of your life and start loving yourself as much as everyone does around you. 
Take yourself away, do something, volunteering and rewarding and exercise. Love and light to you xx"
Any advice for someone dealing with a panic disorder and Agoraphobia? I've done therapy and the doctor has put me on Fluexotine.. I've now got a Twitch in my face and my dad threw me out because he doesn't understand mental health issues. I need help and support.,It's terrible still to this day people don't understand mental illness I'm so sorry to hear your family are not supportive. It would be worth keeping in contact with your GP might have to change your antidepressant in might not be the right one for you. Its worth a try,Please Google BWRT. Its probably the best therapy in the world.

Thank you for letting me post on here. At the beginning of February I broke my foot and the isolation that it caused has had a devastating effect on my mental health. My 23 year old son lives with me but works full time . He was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder in 2017 because of his father's actions . So because of this he and I are very close. This can cause an almost clingy attachment. . He is my only living family. Almost  4  weeks ago on Sunday we had a massive falling out and he left.  I have no idea where he is and he's refusing to speak to me .Despite me trying every avenue.  This is killing me. I've got the most horrendous anxiety and contacted my GP twice but won't give me anything.  I'm not sleeping and when I do I'm waking up drenched in sweat and shaking. I don't really have any close friends as I don't come from the area.  I'm beyond hurt but I'm heartbroken that others know where he is but I don't.  The anxiety is overwhelming and I've seriously considered ending it all twice this week but stopped myself.  Thank you for listening,I’m sure he will return,"Poor you, hang in there as things will get better. Your son I am sure will come back to you maybe not today but sometime as a son needs his mum no matter what. Try and stay positive and maybe link on with some mental health charity organisation as it’s difficult going through this on your own. ❤️🙏🏻"

"Any advice on getting an advocate for my son? He has a long history of mental illness, has a TBI, and receives SSDI. I don’t have guardianship or power of attorney. He had been doing great for a few years but I’m the last few weeks became very manic. We’ve had him at the crisis stabilization unit a couple times, and he had gone to two mental health clinic’s wanting to be seen but the first available appointment was a month or more out depending on the place. The last time at the crisis stabilization he assaulted a staff member and got arrested. He has been asking for treatment, we’ve been asking too and now he is in a jail cell. He hasn’t had any mental health assessment at the jail even though he and I have both requested it. That’s supposed to happen today. I’m so disappointed that calls to the police and our mental health services have been brushed off. I hope the person he assaulted is ok. It’s so sad and I’m a mess.","I can hear the despondency in your post - the sad reality is ALL these services lack resource. Help & support is in many ways a front, because there is no actual content behind the myriad of ‘workers’ & their often pretentious terminologies & institutional speak. Yes I am an angry guy underneath, because I have personal experience of Authorities/Organisations & Institutions & I see the way these structures keeps people perpetually sick. I have no faith in any of their ‘systems’ because it is broken to the core - EVERYWHERE ( not just mental health) - I hope you can find some power in the truth & the fact you have to find your own way - There is no real help - Please remember many of these ‘professionals’ have come from comfortable backgrounds, got their ‘Theoretical Book Knowledge Degree’. Middle & upper level Managers have only one true motivation - to keep their well paid positions, with their spacious detached homes in the leafy suburbs, where little Johnny & Susie go to private school - In time LITTLE JOHNNY & SUSIE will become the ‘EXPERTS’ as psychiatrists or directors of mental health services - WHAT KNOWLEDGE would they have of life at the sharp end - Workers who do it as a vocation WITH HEART don’t climb the managerial ladder & in reality have no power to change things. One worker may have 20 ‘service users’ hence, the ‘service user’ who needs help will get a once a month appointment - The only advice I can give is you have to grab your own recovery & find some mental health fellowships not dissimilar to AA or NA - The idea of one mental health sufferer with SOME RECOVERY helping another who isn’t so far down the line, is without parallel-because they have experience of wearing the same t-shirt as you - unlike LITTLE JOHNNY & SUSIE - We have to get real with ourselves & get honest - With that you can go a fair way 👍 Good Luck",Prayers Amy for Jeff and you!

I sometimes wonder what is the purpose of being here there must be more to life than this. Even at it's finest Life does not seem like such a great deal even when everything is going great it still seems to be a burden. I sometimes think life is just meant to be hell and to get out of this hell you have to motivate yourself to do things that lessen the hell. Sometimes you cannot even do this no matter how many plans and adjustments you make in your life to take out all the negative stuff there is always a third party to affect your vibes usually in the negative way. Very few people interacting your life in a positive way sometimes this is hard to admit to and see. We want to believe our family friends and the people that we interact with have got our best interest but I feel this is not true.,"I know exactly how you feel! I have no advice, but I think when I am going through a depressive episode, everything that you said seems a lot worse. When I am feeling so negative, if possible I try to remind myself it will pass. Sometimes it takes a while. Good days and bad and sometimes it sucks. 
And no offense to anyone, but religion and weed don’t do it for me.","Reach out to myco_davv on instagram, tell him you have anxiety , depression or ADHD and wait for his recommendations and guidelines he’s the best Raman Nijhawan"
"You know what? 

I am done 

I AM DONE trying to impress people around me 

Take as whatever I am done 

Ye if I’m a burden or a regret or whatever negative to them 

THEN I AM 

I AM SO DONE 

IM DONE GIVING MYSELF PHYSICAL BODY PAINS my muscles still hurt from last night’s meltdown 

So who cares if I’m unliked or unloved? Big deal 

I’m not gonna put efforts because of this person I know in real life 

They don’t even care for me 

The way they treat me is like they want me to morph me into their clone 
To be submissive 

To obey them 

Uh ye no 

I have a personality 

SOOOO 
THINK HOW YOU WANT OF ME I AM DONE 

I shall enjoy daily to the fullest 

I shall recover from surgery and make two months and onward stress free 

I am done caring how others perceive me 

I’ll get and do what I want

"When i am in a mood I miss my father,  yet i know things will never change, he will never be the father i dream of or crave. Yet lately ive got to a poont that i realise that he doesn't care,doesnt want a relationship, he doesn't want to put the work in, he doesnt want to have a daughter that needs him, doesn't want to have someone that needs him,  someone that has been told by him that my mental health, selfharm where the reasons he threatened to disown me when I was 16, 25 now and the stuck. That hit like a tone of bricks. Ive never had a bond, never felt close that i can talk, that i can open up and let out my emotions thorughts feelings,  there are times where i wish i didn't let myself hope that he will change.  Having him around so close yet feel like he is the other side of the planet,   it hurts.  Currently curled up in one of his jumpers i stole from my younger sister,  wishing we had any chance of any kind of relationship.  i hate how he makes me feel.  Yet he doesn't even know it.","Disappointed love is devastating,  but try to remember he's the one that's not capable of having a relationship, evolving, or making any effort to move forward. Being the better person is hard, but worth knowing you tried your best regardless. 
My dad used to say we were all a mistake and he never wanted kids but he had 6 kids... eventually I stopped having any expectations of him as a father and was free of the disappointment. 
When I became a parent I made the effort to develop a sort of friendship with him, mostly for my daughter to have a sense of family. I found that I could appreciate him far more when I had no emotional expectations of him as my father but just accepted him as the person he was... before he passed away he thanked me for making the effort and letting him into mine and my daughters life. 
Letting go of expectations isn't easy at first but worth ridding yourself of the torment of years of disappointment.",Really sorry to hear that.  My dad was very bad man. Never really had a dad
"Thanks for letting me join I'm really worried about my son he's suffering 😢 with mental health issues 😞 and I'm really worried I feel helpless he's in his 30s ,he's had 4 relapses and I feel 😢 he's getting worse....carole","I have been struggling with both ADHD and CPTSD  for years it's been hell but I got introduced to micro dosing and I got off all my medications by slowly tappering and didnt need therapy anymore.got recommendations from michael_tripyy  on

What's best way to cope with a partner who is suffering with paranoia because I'm struggling,My partner had this years ago but it was the drink doing it to him but I have not seen it again recently. You may need to reach out to family or a support worker. Sounds like she is in a crisis.,"Relationship scare me, I always end up feeling insecure"

"wonder if anyone could give me any advice...my mum has had mental health problems for along as I can remember....as a teenager she used to walk around the house with scissors and knives in her back pocket 
The police have been called on multiple occasions for disturbses her walking around the streets on her nightie
My dad drank and it always got brushed under the carpet and ignored.
Sadly 5 years ago we lost my dad and i look after my mum 
Cutting the story short the last 5 years she's been attacking me throwing plates cups and other things at me she talks to herself saying very disturbing things 
Monday she came at me with a knife and sliced my hand.i know I should of called the police right away but I just ran
Since then I have reported this to the police but told me unless I press charhed against her they can't do alot and told me to go down the mental health route 
I have contacted the mental health crisis team they have told me they will try contact her via phone call   social services won't do anything 
O have contacted her gp and they won't talk to me without her authorisation 
Is their any other way I can get her help? I can't keep getting verbally and physically abused putting myself or my children's life in danger","I think your priority has to be ensuring you and your children are safe. You can not be putting yourself, and your children in potential danger. 
I know that will be hard, but it’s vital.
You do need to call 999 if you, your family or she is putting herself in danger. 
Can you keep contact and support via phone, video calls etc? 
I take it from the way you have written this that she doesn’t want to seek help for herself? It’s really hard if she doesn’t want to get any help or recognise that she requires it. 
What does she say when you talk to her about getting help?
Is she willing to call the doctor while you are there for example?",Ring 999 and keep ringing them until they do something.
"When people would rather avoid you that tells me the world doesn’t want me , I have no skills, I can’t do anything and I have no friends . I’m sorry I’m alive just now.","How long have you been feeling like this?  Make an appointment with your GP to help. They are great listeners.  Is there something deeper troubling you?  
What are your interests?   
Skills I can see right here.  Your great at writing including spelling etc.",Rob no matter what we all say you will feel the same . My advice is to remember you are a person that has lots to give . Don't ever give up and show the world who Robert Turner is

"How many people have family and friends they don't talk to anymore?
Me both parents died in the 90's my mother in 1990 age 42 my father some time later in the 90's I'm not actually sure about my father tbh I've 3 siblings and I'm the oldest i no longer talk to them hell I've not seen them in a very long time the last time I saw my sister was in 2009 and I'm kool with it here's why we don't talk it's because I'm trans i came out as trans in 2007 after keeping it a secret for decades the family knew when I was a child but this was waaaay back in the 70's when I came out i was going to call myself Rikki victoria because my dead name was Rikki anyway but people kept saying Rikki isn't a girls name but it is so i went with victoria raven instead but people just call me V or Vic do I miss my family fk no why because I still have my daughter.","Last year I tried to support mum through her mental health they responded very strangely, the contact was weird,so I've stepped back because I realise the contact they were making was fake, still a bit raw ,getting my head round it.

"I can't take this anymore, no one understands and just expects me to be normal, have a normal life and have the future that was planed but I'm really unwell but it's not acknowledged cos it doesn't show and so I get pressured to be just who I was before my health problems started.

They can't see cos my autism doesn't allow me to show the horrible pain I'm in everyday, they can't see my vision loss, they can't see my restricted movement, they can't see the persistent tiredness that turns to exhaustion so bad anytime I do something I have to sit or lay down for an hour to get enough strength back to do something else, they can't see any of it so don't believe it's as bad as I say.

Doctors can't find what's causing all this so it's not seen as it no one can explain the cause and cos it's not seen or explained due to a diagnosis that litrally means we don't know what causes these symptoms  I get no help or support just pressure to be normal like I was, despite just getting dressed exhausts me meaning i have to sit down to recover, muscle weakness and pain that makes picking up or carrying anything feel like my arms are being torn off along with horrible intestinal  problems causing me horrible pain and now it turns out malabsorption as I'm not absorbing vitamins and minerals from my food and food supliments aswell as many other health issues none which the doctors can explain or understand the cause of.

So I am not seen not understood, not helped, not supported just pressured to be healthy and normal, get a job and keep it despite my physical health and autism meaning I always get forced out as I'm unable to do the job so I get laid off on health grounds within 3 months of starting and without a job all my plans for me and my wife's future are ruined yet she can't see any of this either and also just pressures me to build the future I promised before I got sick but I don't know how, everything is ruins. 

Ruins I am let sat in alone unseen, not understood not helped not supported and I can't take anymore I just want to go!

Please note I'm too much of a coward too scared of more pain and don't have the physical ability to do anything all I can do is vent.","Venting is a good a source of relief and there’s so many people on here in your shoes. 
Your not alone.

I feel like so many people would be better off without me. I'm just a burden,Always remember that your 'depression thoughts' aren't real. They are just put there to make you feel bad. To make you feel worthless. Your depression mind needs you to believe these thoughts are real. I know it feels like they are but they aren't real. Just know you're not alone feeling this way.

"I need advice as I can’t decide what to do and my brain goes on loop with thinking stressing me out 

But what would you do if someone was being toxic to you non stop ?
Only sharing bad stuff going in their life like I get it we all have stuff but the point you do it so much when you drag others away there’s a limit 

Or controlling you what to do? Or what games to play or be mad when you don’t do what they reccomend 

Cause not gonna lie nothing makes me more mad when people tell me what to do 

And yes I have addressed this to the person many times however they’re not listening 

Well the obvious answer would be get rid of them the thing is I did back in 2018 I’m pretty sure they reached to me on a social media it’s how we rekindled our friendship but deja vu is happening 

And besides that they’re fun and funny and when I think of losing them it kind of hurts since we been friends for a very very long time 

I get people change but stuff change but I don’t know 😕 

I’m so close into ghosting them without words cause I’m so drained but I don’t know",Choose yourself hun. It's either have positive conversations that you can do something about or it's just a vicious negative cycle and explain you aren't in a place where you  an be in that cycle. Make a good life choice about the things going on or don't talk about them. We all need a good rant but it has to call a day eventually and have other conversations of much more worth. Wishing you all the best. Take control of your own life,Say no sometimes. Keep your door locked. This person is too demanding. Perhaps arrange to see her once a week and no more no matter what. You have to exert some control over your life. Be busy.
Morning all. Just a small question as such. My girlfriend of 3 years has decided my mental health issues are my fault and it's why our relationship will discontinue. We are in our 40s and both have children from  the previous wedding. I am not sure she had the right attitude.,"Also, I am shouted at a fair bit which my children witnessed and they have not seen her for a year or spoken to her anymore",Saying that 5 weeks ago I had my children on the weekend as normal my 2 came with me to get my car. She was very hostile towards them and again shouted at me. The irony is I am still with her as if I am afraid to leave
Spiritual health is so important to your mental health It's important to Find your Own balance between the Scientific side of things and the side with all the meaning..the spiritual side .,More importantly it's balancing in knowing who you can talk too on spiritual levels and most people you can't maybe why your own space is important it's your feild of creation,Science tells me I will be on dialysis in two years the spiritual part tells me my kidneys will get better and the rest of my health will get better ￼God already cured of high blood pressure I no longer take heart medication thank you Jesus

"I am really struggling I just left a mental health group this morning for deleting my post. I think it's because I said active duty military because it's true. But I feel alone my family is dead as sad and needy as that sounds. It's true my mom passed from overdose and idk where my dad is. And my ypunger brother had took his own life 2yrs ago.. I just feel lost. Idk where I can't talk and feel okay. I found out I'm pregnant this morning and I don't want to tell my husband and spouse for 6 yrs that I am because of how he is... but I feel alone, stressed and not okay idk if I'll  be okay with another kid. I have 2 beautiful  babies and I've had 3 miscarriages. What if I tell him and I loose it? And he is upset about finding out? I've been through alot from a young age and I don't have anyone in my life to talk to. I do my best. I work, I save and pay what needs to be paid. I don't get help but I feel like I'm not doing enough. I'm raising my 2 kids on my own even tho he lives here with is. I couldn't say the last time he gave a bath, changed a diaper, and has never put them to bed or lose a minute of sleep over them even as a newborn. He thinks work is more then enough if he is paying for everything. His games are his priorities. He has threatened divorce 3 times in 6yrs and the last was 2 days ago and I found out I was pregnant this morning. I'm so screamed he would take my kids just because he has more then me...",See a lawyer or c.a.b. get support from a women's group. You will get custody of your children.

Hi! I’m new here! I have severe bipolar depression and I’m seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow to be started on a new medication. So what I’m really looking for are other peoples stories and types of medication that helped with your mental illness. I’ve been researching for days but still torn on what I want to discuss trying with my doctor tomorrow. TIA for any help!,"Please keep in mind that everyone's body chemistry is different. Just because two people have a similar diagnosis, a particular medicine may have completely different effects between them. A lot of it comes down to trial and error. I only say this to encourage you to not get discouraged if what you try first doesn't work out like you hope.  There are so many medications and therapy treatments out there that you have plenty of options available to you. I wish you all the best. 💕","Sending Love♥️. I understand exactly how you feel.

I don't know how to start everything in my life , I'm really stuck and now I'm 26 and feel useless. There was a time when I thought everything was really difficult for me, and I never got the chance to try many things in my life. I work as a cashier and it is really small store and almost no one came to the store that I work , I'm trying to looking for a job but still cannot find it. I have a bf and I love him so much , we love each other and also the problem is we didn't have same religion and my parents doesn't like him. I don't understand why my life is like that , I really never got what I love and like in my life..On the one hand, I want to protect my parents' feelings and break up with him , but I really love him..Trta Sometimes I think about going far away and starting my life in another country.","Don't split up with your bf if your happy maybe compromise or have conversation with your parents, that  it won't effect your religious belief, they have nothing really to do with him but maybe let them know how happy he makes you because surely they don't want you too sad. I get some religions it is a no but maybe have the conversation because how you wrote this on here the worry of choice and hurting your luvd one is making you sad.","Sending Love♥️. I understand exactly how you feel. Trin_cure on instagram saved my life. I previously struggled with  ADHD, anxiety and depression for years, my meds never worked for me  but then I got introduced to microdosing a few months ago. I gained optimism, spiritual and emotional insights, and being more in touch with my emotions,Improved focus and concentration,creativity as well.

"please help me 

I have had a tough time recently trying to make friends I just don’t understand why this always happens to me at work I feel alone I’ve moved here from where I was when I was in the 10th grade I am now 25 and I still don’t have any friends I only have the friend I have from where I was and she’s all I have not only that but most times I feel like I am not important or unworthy or people like other people more than me I don’t understand myself and I most definitely don’t understand others recently I’ve had a crush on a guy at work and asked him to hang out and he agreed three times even gave me a day but each time did not show up I tend to have a very tough time dealing with emotions and I want to go back to work but I am scared because I feel like I wasn’t myself the last time I was there I tend to sometimes hear and see things when I get very stressed out and even seen letters on a piece of paper moving I didn’t know the guy was lying to me so I kept asking him to go because I really liked him but now I feel like maybe he thinks I’m weak and there all laughing at me I know I’m stronger than this but I don’t understand maybe I did something wrong and I tend to choose certain People to hang around I felt comfortable around him maybe I was mean to him I feel I should apologize it’s been really hard I don’t know if I can go back I felt like they were laughing and doing it on purpose I even let people talk down to me but because I wanted friends I just let them do it and I didn’t care what they said at the time because the only thing that mattered was the guy I like but when he was laughing with them I broke I need to learn to control my Emotions and not get attached beacause it’s my fault I don’t understand what to do",Here if you want to talk,Sending you lots of hugs today baby 🖤
"Hi, i'm new here and just want to tell a little about myself. I've suffered on and off for 10 years with depression it started as post natal depression after my son was born. I am 50 years old and a mother of 2 autistic boys aged 14 & 10. Life is hard enough with them but my mom passed away 2 years ago. She was my best friend and i spiraled again into a depression. I was in an unhappy marriage so decided last year to get out of it. I feel sometimes like i am being swallowed up and just want to cry all the time and other times i feel on top of the world. Today is a bad day. 🥺
Thankyou for listening.","Hang in there things will get better. Take one day at a time. Good luck, thinking of you ❤","Sending you love and strength  💕 take each day as it comes. You will get to have more and more good days. Depression is a battle, but you will win. You need to make time to concentrate on you and your needs, every mum needs that.  Xx"
"If you are employed I'm just wondering how people mentally cope with working? If someone gives me the slightest bit of ""constructive criticism"" I can't cope. It makes me doubt everything it make me even doubt I should be allowed to be alive. Any tips? 😭",I also have issues maintaining employment. The last few years I done remote jobs (work from home) which does help but I've also recently filed for disability to see if I'll be approved because then I can work part-time which will also help. It is a struggle but I have to make a living one way or the other.,Shame is probably the most devastating emotion to cope with but it can be healed. Avoidance will help short term but can do much more harm than good. Healing shame comes through finding a sense of worth for who you are and not what you do. It's a tough issue to solve but I would guess it's been a long struggle and in many areas. There is help and even if it's a  tough process your life will improve in ways you cannot imagine.

My sister suffer from severe mental health.  And recently she been called up for Jury service for early 2024.  Which isn’t helping with  her mental health.    Any advice would be kindly appreciated.",She can decline to go by mentioning her mental health issues thats wot I did.,"She can request to not be part of it due to mental health / ""disability"" reasons 💛"
"Idk of im overthinking or what but i feel some kinda way ....my daughter thats back in the mental hospital asked me to try ams get her dads number so she can talk to him about her mental health (he has it to) but she hasnt tslked to him in lile 3years hes not in her life ... 
Shes 15.",I would let her calm him if she wants. I’m sure she wants to ask questions about his mental health,She needs answers its a hard place in there and especially at a young age always thunking to find reasons. If you don't have a good reason to hide it then be honest
What has everyone been up today?,I've been to asda and sat in the garden,Sleeping
I fell asleep quite easily tonight but ½ hour later I've woke up in a state of panic feeling like I can't breathe. I'm exhausted but every time I try to sleep I have a panic attack feeling like I can't breathe. I'm so sick of it now it's been like this for 7 weeks. Feeling worried and anxious 😥,"Ayse Acar  Thanks for reaching out and sharing. Panic attacks are the worst and everybody deals with it differently. There are medication which could help you and you need to talk to a medical professional for that. Else, you could talk and calm yourselves with professional listeners like myself",Smoke some weed

How is everybody on this fine day?,,"So happy. Celebrating my daughter's lockdown birthdday starting with early morning yoga in the field, pancakes, dressing up in 1920s clothes for a themed birthday, watching a heartwarming video made by all her friends and family, getting and takeaway tonight and having an outdoor cinema!"
Hello all I'm new to the group. I didn't know where to turn I've been dealing with mental illness for years but more recently the last few have been the worst. I have major anxiety and trust with people but also suffer from ptsd which makes things worse. I hope to talk to others who have dealt with this or similar. I'm at the end of my rope,i suffer from OCD PTSD GAD Borderline personality and Bipolar type 1 with psychosis take ur meds and go to therapy do DBT or CBT support groups are always nice,"So I've just joined this group. 
I take away something special. 
I'm not alone.

"Update: 

It’s been 1 week already since my surgery im still pretty bruised and most laying in bed taking easy recovering not have any hiccups but I do feel much better im on the phase where things are healing and very itchy so it’s a urge I should ignore",Glad to you made through the surgery and hope you have a quick recovery,so sorry
Had trauma assessment I've come from primary mental health to community mental health what's the difference,"I believe that trauma is basically something done in hospital, like assessments or stays in a mental health ward, community is as it suggest you'll now be seen by the community mental health team, who support people back in the community,  so the community mental health team have mental health nurses, a psychiatrist etc. So it should be a local CMH team to your area.","So sorry for how you feel mate ❤️.... l will suggest you reach out to (prime_tyms) on Instagram, He's a good mycologist, just tell him what you might be going through such as BPD, ADHD, PTSD anxiety, depression or panic attack and wait for his recommendations and guidelines. His prescriptions has been amazing. I recently purchased Golden teacher mushrooms for my mental health 😊💙"
I went to the doctors this morning and begged 4 help. The emergency mental health contacted me and basically said to just go and speak to therapists. I have one already. I start new meds tomorrow and I am petrified that nobody is really listening to me. I asked to be sectioned but they wont do it. Because I can verbally tell them that I am not well I go to the bottom of the queue. Unless I physically harm someone or myself nothing can be done and it is just crazy.,Im listening 😊,"So sorry for your experience, just DM me now I would like glad to listen and not judge you"
Lost my dad today. I looked after him for 7 years he had dementia. It's hard knowing that parents are not here anymore 😢,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't even begin to imagine that level of grief. I'm sure he would be very proud of you and wouldn't want you to suffer. Please remember he is always with you.... You are him and he is you. He left you as his future and wants you to shine bright.

Grief comes in waves. You will get through it. Some times will be easier than others. But essentially... You will do him proud my love and I'm sure that's all he ever wanted. You have stepped into a new timeline. One where you have to be the strength you saw in him.

Sending lots of love your way. Xx",So sorry for your loss
"I lost someone very close to me today, I should have tried harder, I should have been there, but due to some traumatic things I’m going through I couldn’t and now it’s too late and completely my fault. Really struggling to cope and have no1 to turn too",Don't be hard on yourself. Sometimes we can only do our best. Chin up,"So sorry for your loss 😔 this is such a hard time even without regrets, the same happened to me in 2022 when my dad died, many regrets and sadness things couldn't have been different due to my problems and where I was headwise up until his death, we can grow through these things, it's the time to love yourself and go gently with yourself here, similar situation as you I didn't have anyone during that time, I managed to get myself on the list for counselling which I started a year later and things have improved, try find yourself some support if you can whatever that may look like, I found it helpful to read online some grieving literature and I found some herbs that support during grieving.. ♥ ♥ ♥"
"I had a really goodish day yesterday but the crippling anxiety is back with a vengeance.  I had spoken to a GP on Friday who was not someone I'd spoken to or had dealings with. Couldn't understand what he was saying for most of the call Gave me crisis numbers for over the weekend and said he'd call me today. He did and again I really struggled to understand him. Asking how I was and I told him ,I wasn't sleeping or eating andvmy heart rate was 97/106 There were just long silences. I've now spoken to him abd another Gp two weeks ago and they won't prescribe me anything to take the edge of this. I did stupidity say I just wanted this to end and maybe that's why. I have fibromyalgia which I take really strong  controlled drugs for ,so if I was suicidal some diazepam weren't going to be the tablet of choice 
Still crippled with overwhelming anxiety and no further forward . When I put the request in on Friday I asked for a specific GP who I've dealt with before, who's had mental health issues in the past so is empathetic and knows me",when I first lost my sight I was in a really bad way the doctors prescribed me medication but every tablet which I took made me very suicidal so Blind Veterans UK got involved and it took them two years to get me sorted out and now here I am 10 years later and a far better person mentally,So sorry you are suffering Emma. Message me if I can help xx
Wife wants to separate and now she says things not fixable I'm so lost and alone no friends just my kids no body talk to nobody to lesson I love this girl more than anything I don't want to push her away any further I at least want to keep her friendship she's that important in my life and kids,Sometimes in marriage we grow in different directions and that’s ok.  What’s important is for you both to be there for kids during this difficult transition.  Look into a support group for those going through a divorce.  It will help talking with others going through the same.,So sorry. Can u take a vactaion maybe a solo vacation so u can come up with a plan and decompress?
"When im going home soon, yet feeling unsure as i dont know what I will be walking into.   Mental health sucks especially as family don't understand.",So true,So true
"No matter how many bad days we all have. We should all be proud at the fact, we are still here and not given up. Because we don't deserve to 👊💪",Totally agree!!!,So true
,,So true I believe if I can act it I can do it.
,I very intelligent and mentality fit,So true.
When silence has benefits ❤️,"I agree in principal, but too much silence isn't always beneficial",So true. Too much of anything isn’t good for us in general. It’s definitely about balance 😊
Truth!!!,it certainly does,So true. We all need to grow and mature and not be victims
"I'm so disappointed in myself that i keep turning to alcohol to try sort my problems.  My problems are in my head. I have a loving husband ( if he didn't love me he'd left by now)  two gorgeous children, family support yet I still feel so alone     ..…",Maybe you need more. A job. Social outings. Sports. Educational classes. Good luck,So what do you feel is the root of the problem?  What does the alcohol numb out??
So I finally got that confirmation that I’m actually mentally ill. But it actually feels good when everybody’s been telling me that I’m lying and I am on substances. ￼ Can anyone relate?￼,I can,So what now? I have been getting the runaround from my insurance for last week and a half trying to find help.
I'm really pissed off right now it's unreal I've not long got bk from the police station here's why so this morning i go into town and go to Iceland where i get milk and a ready meal i pay for it all and leave as I'm walking home i notice that someone is following me it was my 2nd ex gf and her son the woman who treated me like shit when I was with her for almost 10 years as I'm about to turn the corner to go to mine I'm knocked to the ground and kicked by those 2 people thankfully there was a person near by and came over and got those people off me the woman called the police on those people ( if you can call them that ) unfortunately the 2 people run off ( gd thing i know who they are and where they live.) 5 minutes later the police turn up thankfully i knew one of the officers the woman explained to the officers what happened i was better than bruised cuts on my face and in a lot of pain from my right shoulder the one with arthritis the woman came with me to the police station she did a statement then was allowed to go i thanked her for her help my friend helped clean me up and looked at my shoulder which was badly bruised she took a photo of my shoulder and my face and head i told my police friend where they live and there names her partner left to go to the address while my friend stayed with me then at 6.15am i was allowed to go home my friend said that she will make sure that they get punished for what they did i was also told that I don't have to go to court because of my mental health plus they have photos of my injuries.,"I had similar experience with my husband even with all the signs i confronted him but he lied about the affair, someone actually talked to me about eric_cyberhacker who could link his phone remotely direct to mine without him knowing or touching his phone before I was able to get evidence from his chat and text messages even deleted conversations directly to my phone. I strongly recommend if you need such help on Facebook Eric Cyberhacker",So you know who was following you. I was about to ask. Why were you being followed? Do you know? Why did they hurt you?
How are you lovely people coping today?,"Not bad thanks, hope your'e well ☺","So, all my good intentions of the first few weeks have gone to pot over the last two, frustrated and annoyed with myself😡"
"Hi everyone I'm really interested in what keeps you motivated? What gets you through the day, week, month etc need some inspiration!",Prayer depending on my moon cleaning my house  going to church being with my friends if I get anxiety I color it keeps me focus walk the dog watching my favorite tv shows  I try to keep busy doing all these things makes me feel like I have accomplished something and then I feel good about myself,Sobriety has helped immensely! Eating well and exercise plays a role as well… setting small goals so I don’t overwhelm myself… each person is different. I do hope you find what works best for yourself! You got this. 🙂
How to overcome social anxiety?,Don't go out,Socialise with small groups and likeminded people
"I’m not being racist or anything I am black my self. I feel like black guys always put me down and do me the worst . Literally wether we friends , dating or i just know them .. they talk to me real bad and make me feel worthless. And I never know what to say or how to stick up for myself . I hate that it is my own race and sometimes even my own blood . I’m so tired of it . I start to hate my self for allowing such awful things to be said and done to me . It’s almost like I can’t escape it 😭😭😭 I need prayers",I tend to see they come up with the worst immature insults.,Some of them feel bad about themselves and/or women in their family.
"I should stop thinking but I just reflected on this 

I just noticed my mom is very jealous whenever I socialize 

Many times in public she would glare at me whenever I talked to people in public 

I have two times I can deeply remember 

1. I was about to enter Starbucks and this lady got her shoulder bag  stuck on a chair and I commented “oh no… I hate when that happens” ( cause I also own one and I know the feeling) 
And I swear my mom’s eyes went wide and she gave me the meanest look as like “why would you do that? 

2: at Costco, so okay I love wearing alternative fashion with stand out colors dunno if you guys know Decora kei fashion but I followed that I still do not as much so yeah I was wearing my hair in pigtails and cute clothing and someone went “nice outfit” and I replied thanks and mom did the same thing 

And now with online whenever she would see me getting along with people instead of her being proud she’d give me a look 

Like… 

You want me for yourself only? 

That’s so unhealthy",Okay maybe Mom is trying to protect you. You seem a very open and trusting person and Mum knows the world isn't very trusting. She probably cares a bit too much and is scared watching you grow up. Idk 🤷‍♂️,Some people don't like people doing random talking. its strange its ok if the person you speak to was ok with it. but the person you was with was not its a bit of a wierd one . I get this problem i think it must happen to everybody
"I feel like I'm going to die soon. I'm not feeling well at all. I lived with chronic illnesses and chronic pain with mental health illnesses for so many years. The doctors have ignored me and I lived without meds because they refuse to help me. I've searched for years for  good doctors  but with no avail I have yet not found any. I'm not looking for pity, just support. All I do is lay in bed. I am exhausted all the time and in pain. I do not think I can give all the details of what's wrong with me right now, but if you want to know anything feel free to ask. I'm just making peace with the Lord and preparing myself. I told my family but they refuse to accept it. I've been making arrangements. I just feel sad for my children that I may have to leave them so soon. I have to trust the Lord to take care of them. I didn't get to see my youngest sons very married yet or to spend time with my grandchildren. My dog Leo will be 11 years old in January.  He's an old little guy and blind. I was hoping he goes before me because he's been with me 24hours a day for 11 years. He is my emotional support. He will feel very sad if I go first. I just want to thank all of you that took the time to read this. Your friendship means a lot to me. I may not have known you personally, but I've been praying for you. Remember that I love you and I hope and pray that the Lord will help each one of you and your families and friends. God bless you. ❤️","Tell me more about Leo, I am a ""dog"" person also, and in my 70's. A pet is more than an animal to me. They are family, sometimes, well most of the time, they are all you have to talk to, (here), we talk to the Lord also, but we don't physically see him yet.🤗","Something similar happened to me years back. I was in tremendous pain, I could not get out of the bed. I remember having to go to work, crying in the bus and whatnot. I went to different doctors, all of them dismissed me. My husband called emergency services and their response was - she is spoiled, give her tea. A day after that night, when he called emergency services I collapsed in the bus on the way home. It turned out I had internal bleeding. They had to revive me a couple of times, because they kept losing me, but in the end, thanks to God and the doctor who didn't want to let me go, to put it that way, I survived. I feel your pain, but please hold on. Don't think about dying - you have wonderful children and they need their mother. Trust me. They need you. Regardless of their age, they will always need you. I have kids, so I know. Please, just hold on. And if you ever need to talk to someone, we are all here 🫶"
Do you ever feel like your life is like wet sand and everyday your sinking further down and your never going to get out that’s how I feel I just don’t want to be like this anymore I just want to get out of the sand,"Yes, I've felt like this too many times to count. I like your analogy.💗 I used to describe it as just needing the world to stop spinning for a moment so I could catch up.
The one thing I know about wet sand or even quicksand...it's usually a case of someone else pulling you to safety.
I wonder if this feeling might be telling you it's time to ask for help? Or even time to trust others to take over or get you out of a tought situation?","Sometimes it feels Asif you're balanced on a very slippery, tiny rock under that quick sand, and one small push is all it needs to go down"
"My personal and professional life both suck ! I don’t know what to do , people who listened are tired of listening .. I feel completely up against the wall ! Sometimes I can’t breath out of anxiety , I cry my self to sleep most nights.. Anyone else feel the same ?",You want to talk about it,"Sometimes mate, but a true friend will listen,and support you no matter what. Always around if you need chat, and its never a problem xx"
,Need friendships to support me,Sometimes that’s a harder question to answer than you would think. 
"Wish there was euthanasia for people like me in my country. I would choose on it in a heart beat. Then I would float on the sea of non-existence, forever. No more sleepless nights and overthinking. 

So I have Borderline intellectual disability, which means that i suck at everything and i can't interact with others well. I am in the depths of hell and i always have been, i can't imagine what a normal life feels like, even if i forced myself. My friend count is zero, because i can't have meaningful conversations or imagine how other people feel like, so i could be somewhat relatable. That's roughly my story.","I hope this message can help as that helped me too, After I have experienced many bad things in life i’ve found faith in Jesus. I would say no matter the situation we are in, my advice is let’s try to give all pains and ask forgiveness to Him with our hearts today. We can’t understand yet everything in life but things can change in faith! Remember the suffering we have here is temporary and our life can change trough Him! Seek help in Jesus",Sometimes the burden is too great for other people to be listening. Keep conversation to things of common interest like music movies hobbies holidays and so on. I would never try to persuade anyone on religion. There are many different spiritual paths. Yoga for example. Some people do experience spiritual healing for physical and mental problems. Some things you can only experience for yourself not by what others say.
"My husband was diagnosed with bipolar and manic and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Some of the items he bought were 2 motorcycles and a car.  He ended up signing the titles over to a friend who now refuses to give his property back.  Since these were purchased while being manic before he got a diagnosis, any experience with this? This person won’t return any of my calls or texts.  She is also a social worker and took advantage of my husband’s money when he thought he was a millionaire and was giving it away to everyone.",That's awful shame on her. Make an complaint against her to safeguarding they'll investigate,"Sorry but its legally gone! Once he signed over the titles it's no longer his property 😔 sucks but nothing you can do! I have similar mental health diagnosis and I'm not getting anything back I gave away or signed over to anyone, the world doesn't work that way! Sorry for your situation maybe become his legal guardian or his payee idk good luck"
I feel like shit,Ditto friend ditto,Sorry for that
"Yesterday marked 9 years since my father left this world. I had a good day yesterday, but today I’m in pieces.. I keep having flashbacks and replaying the day over and over. I don’t think it will ever get easier…😔","I don't think we ever overcome the death of a loved one. More that we adapt and get used to it. My dad passed away in 1986 and he was only 32, I was 10 at the time. My mum passed recently 28.2 at 65. Wishing you all the best. Try to remember good times.",Sorry for ur loss hun hugs on the way
"Trigger??
I lost my husband today. He lost his battle with addiction or a seziure. We don't know for sure. I have 2 boys who lost their step father and saw it. I don't know how to cope. I don't know what to do to make this better.","For anyone tonight considering ending it all. Please let me beg you to not. Just hold on for one more hour, or one more day or whatever it takes. This is permanent. Pain is temporary. Even when you feel alone there is always at least one person who will truly suffer for your absence. He thought the same over and over and I swear we all wish this didn't happen. Just please hold on and know you truly are loved and cared about.b",Sorry for your loss sending love and hugs Kim ❤️🤗
"I'm so frustrated, I was diagnosed with Tardive Dyskenesia in 20l7 and now I don't trust any medication, but now my depression is really bad and so intense I can barely stand it😔","Renee Dumas I understand that you're going through a challenging time, and I'm here to offer some insights. It's important to remember that everything is curable and that includes your current situation. While Tardive Dyskinesia can be a difficult condition to manage, there are treatments available that can help alleviate the symptoms.
These may include herbal remedies, such as valerian root or passionflower, which are believed to have calming effects on the nervous system. Acupuncture and acupressure techniques may also be considered, as they aim to restore the body's energy balance.
 As for your depression, it's crucial to seek professional help and explore various options to find a suitable treatment plan. Remember, with a growth mindset, you have the ability to overcome obstacles and find solutions that work for you. Stay resilient and reach out to medical professionals who can guide you on your journey to better mental health.",sorry forgive my uh unintelligence here but is that like ticks not stimming but whats it called.. tourretts syndrome? a subconcious thing no? :)
"When I think that I'm ""in trouble"" either at work or with my partner I find it hard to look the person I'm talking to (the accuser) in the eye. Could this potentially be an autistic trait?  Sorry I know autism isn't a mental illness but don't know where else to ask.","Please note: that Autism is a genetic condition NOT a mental health issue.
HOWEVER it can affect peoples mental health.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. Some people with ASD have a known difference, such as a genetic condition. Other causes are not yet known. Scientists believe there are multiple causes of ASD that act together to change the most common ways people develop. We still have much to learn about these causes and how they impact people with ASD.

People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. There is often nothing about how they look that sets them apart from other people.  The abilities of people with ASD can vary significantly. For example, some people with ASD may have advanced conversation skills whereas others may be nonverbal. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others can work and live with little to no support.

ASD begins before the age of 3 years and can last throughout a person’s life, although symptoms may improve over time. Some children show ASD symptoms within the first 12 months of life. In others, symptoms may not show up until 24 months of age or later. Some children with ASD gain new skills and meet developmental milestones until around 18 to 24 months of age, and then they stop gaining new skills or lose the skills they once had.

As children with ASD become adolescents and young adults, they may have difficulties developing and maintaining friendships, communicating with peers and adults, or understanding what behaviors are expected in school or on the job. They may come to the attention of healthcare providers because they also have conditions such as anxiety, depression, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which occur more often in people with ASD than in people without ASD.",Sorry if I've annoyed or upset anyone with my question. It is a genuine question and no malice was intended. I'm going through a really bad time at present personally and professionly and I am questioning every single detail about myself.
I lost my partner two years ago and it’s our wedding anniversary tomorrow is it still an anniversary do I say would have been or we have been married for that amount of time I’m thinking about it we talked about getting old together and now we are not and I’m here on my own with my child struggling with no family or friends and it’s hard sorry for rambling I have no one else to talk to this group helps x,I'm here also,"Sorry love.
U can chat with me."
"Im interested in mental health. I try to be a listener as well as read. My own mental health is variable however. I’ve tried about thirty times to contact my support worker. Every time she is out of the office or off sick or not answering her phone. I can’t go to the office without an appointment. I just want to know if I have a care plan and what it is. I’m under the team. My consultant and support worker agreed I’d be seen weekly. I have had one appt with my support worker in late January. At the mh team. 

Even if I can’t get a worker to visit me myself I’m passionate about doing all I can myself in life for me for the world and above all for mental health issues. 

I just want to find out what my care plan or purpose is but it’s hard to contact the team to find out. More urgently still I want to find ways of doing anything at all that can help generally. I’m a puzzle designer have huge interests in the classics literature and music. I write creatively every day and have done for thirty five years. My mental health issues are ongoing and difficult but when though I suffer in fact because of it I’m motivated to really do more and more and more. Opportunities are sometimes difficult but at least there’s nothing to stop me doing research from books and trying to read and listen more. Much more

At a time when resources are constrained I would do all I can myself. I have been spoken of in the same breath as Lewis Carroll and Archimedes in my puzzle skills. I am really keen to find a really original way to use puzzles classical music creative writing. Audiobooks I make myself. Anything to make mental health and well being better. I do not understand why I have had so much difficulty from organisations services and charities in the past from allowing me to do my best for society

There are always always things I can do myself in learning more. From Aesops fables onwards. I just hope to inspire as the best people have inspired me. But it’s true that deep mental 
Illness its isolating effects can provide one with an unusual and hopefully inspirational insight and perspective on life which one wouldn’t ordinarily have

Best wishes",RunMojoRun,Sorry to hear ❤️ the last support worker I had said I was probably depressed because I was overweight and because me and my husband have a 7 year gap between our age it must be like living with an old man! To say I was not amused was an understatement. No support worker for me anymore don't need that negativity in my life
"Not really sure how to start this as it going to be so long i dont even know where to start but dont really have anyone else to talk to about this kind of thing. topic is relationships with anxiety and depression so if its not your cup of tea please feel free to keep scrolling. 
just wondered if it was just me. 

I really am at my breaking point and dont really know what else to do. i am only 4ft9 now so as a teen i was picked on a lot in school. it didnt help that i was over weight for my age. long story short i was the girl the lads picked on as if they liked me to wind there mates up or the dear part of truth or deer. as i have got older without going into to much detail i was just used to the point where where they stated if he went near me he was pissed at the time. i got to a desprate point and feel that way again but i cant let it happen again. no one has liked me for me. i have a complete fear that i am not going to have a partner as i dont really get out the house. been around people that are a lot younger then me with the just friends stage but you clearly know something is going on and to thing i am missing that the older i get its just killing me.i dont go out the house and cant even look at a picture of me as i just do not like the way i look.",Forgot there wasn’t a pic of me I don’t like taking them because of my size very rear I get a full one,Sorry to hear that but I do have a good friend who works on lifeline in Cambridge so if u want the number let me know
"Hello everyone. 

I'm feeling stuck, I've been feeling stuck for a long time now. I don't want to do the things I know I should be doing to make my life and my mood better. I'm not doing thoes things partly because I don't know how and partly because I have other responsibilities. (mainly family) that are taking up a lot of my time. I'm having to take care of a family member and i am the only one. I have to do the cooking, cleaning, shopping. Than there's also the stuff I have to do for myself. I don't have a lot of energy or motivation to begin with,  and with everything I need to do by the time I'm done I don't have any more energy or motivation left to do what I need to do for myself. (at least the things I know how to do) every day it seems like I have less energy, less motivation and less hope. I just sort of shut down and all I want to do is do nothing,  just stay in bed.","Sounds like you are stressed big time you can’t take care of others until put yourself first if it continues you might be looking for a break down are you seeing a therapist or maybe a psychiatrist your family needs boundaries I know how it feels to have to be in
charge","Sorry to say ,but i think your verging on depression ,what with the wanting to stay in bed(comfort) and not face the world.
My advice(been through similar), speak to a trusted someone within your life ,who knows you ,and start immediately. Also ,see if you can delegate something to relieve some pressure on yourself, or get some one to help out with your responsibility."
"Hi I’m new 
I want to get better n feel better every one around me is doing so well and I feel a failure and useless

"Hi guys. Just want some advice really. 

I’m at a all time low. Iv been like it on and off since I was 19 (33 now) 
I have 2 boys 10 and 3. One has adhd and emotional issues. I’m doing all I can to try help him but I’m so down and miserable myself for reasons I do not know. Lose my temper quite a bit I stress so easily and have no energy to do a lot of things. Sometimes I think i could just remove myself from life and have done. Why am I never happy. I wish I could just snap out of it. It’s strange cos I have a very supportive family but I just feel so alone. I think I may have bipolar or personality disorder of some sort but when I see doctor they put it down to depression every time. 

I need a big boost In happiness!!!","Hi there. I am sorry to hear you're having a tough time. Have you considered you may have ADHD or perhaps be autistic yourself? These things are genetic. If you are struggling with energy and emotional regulation, this sounds very much like what I have experienced myself and also seen in my neurodivergent friends and clients around me. If you are neurodivergent in some way, you'll likely feel bad because you're not able to tailor your life to meet your needs...simply because you're not fully aware of what they are. Do talk to your GP or reach out to a peer support group for help. Help is out there. But, seriously, as a person who was simply told they had anxiety for years...take some time to find out what the deal is with your brain so you can make the life that it needs. I wish you truly all the very best.","Sorry, one final point. I don't like to assume anything but you don't say if you're a mum or a dad. It shouldn't matter but GPs time and again tell women it's just depression when they're actually neurodivergent. It's what happened to me and to many of my late diagnosed clients. If you want a sympathetic GP, I find the younger ones are more aware of the latest research and are open to the idea that all adults can have things like ADHD."
I have just told one of my online friends that they are no longer a friend. They were making me feel even more useless and inadequate. I still can't stop crying as really hurts. I have one other but probably better to have no one. Then no one can hurt me or let me down. I feel so miserable and lonely.,That definitely sucks. I had to cut my own brother offer so I know how hard it can be. We have to do what's best for us and sometimes that means cutting people off.,"sorry.

What does it mean when your heart is beating/racing,"Well, you could start noting down when does it happen. Does it happen when you think about someone or something? Is that a positive thought or does it cause anxiety? Does it happen while you are exercising, taking the stairs? How often does it happen?","Sound like a panic attack.  I know it may sound stupid but breath in through your nose for 10 sec, hold for 5 sec, breath out through your mouth slow. Do that a few times it helps."
"I'm jobless for long years due to my many illnesses which includes some mental health illnesses. I've been able to get odd jobs on and off but never was able to hold onto jobs for long.

I had a major cancer scare at 19 years old, I was diagnosed with mental health illnesses in my early 20s, then other chronic illnesses just accumulated over the long years.

My mom and older sisters would tell me how if I wasn't born, the family would have money to spend and better lives because of the extra cash, not having to spend a single cent on me since I was born.

I'm in my 40s now.

I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't really gamble, just I buy lottery tickets once in a long while.

I've never married, never had kids.

I recently bought a lot of books on various topics, both ebooks and print books. I enrolled in some online courses to pick up new skills.

But I'm procrastinating a lot because of the old fears that I have about me being a loser, living a loser life. According to my mom, if I'm able to pay my own bills, then I'm not a loser.

I'm reading Dr Keith Merron's book called The Art of Transformational Coaching currently to change my mindsets.

How does one overcome procrastination?

Thanks.",Believe in yourself.,"Sounds familiar to me, and I am so sorry family made u feel that way - I think everyone deals differently & you really have to find what works for you but I will say that it sounds like you’re on the right track- you’re doing research and reading books- & that shows that you wanna make a positive change in yourself- to me that is HUGE so great job! 
What works for me is establishing a realistic routine. I don’t put too much on my plate - I have to work because BILLS, ya know- but I started back part time and worked myself up to working more hours- I also write my thoughts in a journal- I do a 10 minute morning meditation or I find a good (uplifting) podcast to listen to while I get ready for the day. I also practice gratitude every morning and throughout the day. I spend time outdoors with fresh air, nature and sun - even just sitting on my porch or walking around the yard- I stay off social media- I have this page and a TikTok but I only follow positive groups and pages- or mental health aware groups and pages - no family or friends- that was one of the hardest changes but most rewarding in my opinion - and I joined an app called circles - it’s like group therapy but not in person 🫶🏼 

I hope that helped some - and I wish you the best on your journey!

I believe in you
You got this 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼"

"Newbie here! Hi everyone! I'm looking for support and suggestions to help my elderly MIL. My parents in law seem to have been hiding that they haven't been able to cope for some time...uncovered when FIL admitted to hospital, and then a nursing home due to falls (advanced Parkinsons). MIL is not coping alone, and I can't seem to get her to see that we need to seek input from Doctor/mental health/adult social care. She's not eating, not sleeping, the house is falling apart (roof leak, holes in floors, kitchen sink & cupboard about to collapse, cooker is filthy and broken, there's mice etc), and there's a hoarding situation going on. Hubby and spent all weekend working there. We replaced the bathroom floor, the toilet and basin, fixing a leak, removed rotting and mouldy groceries (still in bags on kitchen floor), placed rodent poisons. I don't know how to get through to her to let me get help involved, and we don't want to make that decision for her, she'd be so hurt (she's a proud Yorkshire woman who doesn't want to make a fuss). Any suggestions very gratefully received.","We are having her stay over at our house, every few days (especially while we did her house repairs). She said that she's petrified of being alone. She eats at our house, which is reassuring, but I can't convince her to take a bath or shower, which is something she can't manage safely at home. We've had some lovely girlfriend type chats about all sorts (music, birthing & parenting, culture, politics, even health issues like IBS etc.) so she's not shy and we get along well - I'm also a retired nurse. I played it low-key and suggested a nice bath/shower to save her heating bill, and also so I could be nearby in ear-shot if she needed help. Big nope , that would not be necessary thank you. Oops. But she did let me take her to the mobility shop and buy a walker/trolley thing which I hope will give her confidence a boost.",Sounds like she is mentally ill. Would she go to the gym or out for walks in the park?
No judgment here but I’m diagnosed as a psychopath. I act implusively and say nasty things without realising. How do I change this? Some part of me wants to change whilst the other part doesn’t.,"Are u on any meds hun, and ur impulsiveness may not change bcus i suffer from it as well thanks to my eupd and other issues.",Sounds more like Trauma and Self sabotaging because the world wants to make us Into what they expect of us... If your hurting on the inside Then its easy to lash out at others.. just know your triggers and Know there is nothing wrong with how you are.. You were made a way for a reason and don't let society Label you with something because they dont understand you or you have A different Opinion or way of being... The world expects you to change to suit its standard but my friend the world needs to change for you... Express yourself the way you want to deep within...as long as no ones hurt who cares what others think as long as you love yourself.... Your perfect as you are... Only change for you no one else... Try practising meditation and connecting with your inner child more... You have a purpose and the best way to find it is by Doing what lights you up and brings you joy xx you are a piece of creation itself expressing itself thru the beauty that it you x

"Healthy food is important for mental health.

I am going to have chicken vegetable soup with barley for dinner tomorrow night.

 I will put in three chicken thighs, a package of butternut squash, a package of pearly onions, three carrots, two parsnips and two turnips. I will use two packages no sodium chicken powders, two teaspoons garlic powder, two teaspoons onion powder and two teaspoons poultry seasoning. I will use about six cups of water as my base. I will add 1/2 a cup of barley about an hour before it's done. I will take out the three chicken thighs, let them cool, break up the meat, return it to the pot and throw away the bones. After I dish it up, I will sprinkle in some parsley flakes to give it color. I know that it will be delicious.

I will cook it low and slow for 8 hours in my Crock-Pot. I will start it in the morning and it will be done in time for dinner. I will let it rest before eating after I dish it up.",Healthy food is the foundation of good mental health I agree... I'd also like to note. I love my crockpot. I know I named hi named him uncle sam,Stacy Lynn I know what you mean. I use the food bank and food stamps too. Sometimes they give me things that I can't use or don't use. I share them with my neighbors that can use them. I don't use a lot of canned goods because they're high in sodium. I live in a low income apartment high-rise. We have a set of shelves in the lobby where we can put the food from the food banks that we don't use. That way our neighbors can benefit from that food. Sometimes I find food on the shelving unit that I can use.
"One day I would love to have a job with mental health. I wish there was programs called ""each one teach one"" which means to me. You can't teach no one if you haven't been thru a deep situation  yourself.  Not just knowledge  from a text book. ...I don't I'm just venting this morning. I think I  just wanna help...",Great shout. This was primarily why I created this group as a way for others to share their experiences and in a way provide informal therapy. 👍,Start by looking at mental health places near you  where you can volunteer.

You are in the stages of grief, denial, anger, bargaining, pain, depression and acceptance. 
Once you accept that you have done nothing wrong, that either you have a chemical imbalance or a synapsis isn’t firing properly you can forgive yourself and accept it. 
Then you can move on with your life. 
If you don’t, you will be stuck in a loop of pain, anger, denial, depression and guilt."
"Ignored

Do you remember as a kid that horrid feeling of being ignored? When you fell out with a friend so they used it to punish you? or if you had behaved in a way parents didn't like so they just left you to stew in your own world of loneliness resulting in you feeling trapped and resenting yourself. Sobbing in your room wishing you were an adult so you could at least you had the power to change things....Well here is the gutting blow. I'm a full grown adult now. and being ignored is now pretty much my life...friends of past are just that....I'm just a memory of some fun times they probably giggle over with the present friends. 
Parents??? The more time they get in their life the less I seem to be included. But I guess it's their time to enjoy freedom now I'm grown so I can't blame them. 
Partner ..... urgh... I don't know where to start! Not without going back to the state of sat there sobbing like 7 year old me in my bedroom. Yet now I don't have my own bedroom to go and blub in.... I don't have even the time to cry privately in the bathroom...not without a 4 year old banging the door and shouting "" I need a poo!"" I thought being am adult would be easier but the truth is I'm now ignored by a whole world! yep everyone in it! My family, my children, my husband...and as for being able to change things? I'm more trapped now than ever because leaving in anyway would just damage my children so isn't an option. 
So today I got up at 5am. I'd been feeding and burping the baby since 3am anyway. While gently patting her back and trying to stay awake...listening to husband next to me snoring, oblivious even after many children that this lonely night ritual happens. So I thought I'm going to treat myself to that chance to cry. quietly carrying little one downstairs to hug on the sofa as I wait for the chaos of the day to arrive with loud excited feet rumbling down the stairs in search of breakfast cereal. 
 It's valentines today.... I got hubby a gift as you do. it had been in my shopping basket weeks while I waited to see if I could make money stretch enough this month to buy it. Of course he got me a little something too. he asked what I wanted the other day as he ""better get it ordered"" I sent him the links to a cook book so I could do some baking with the children...He looked up from his lap top 3 minutes later smiled at me and said ""done!""....before resuming the position he will be in till at least midnight of staring at his screen. My only interaction is listening to the odd rant as he opens an email. I can have a full blown chat with him. Tell him something really important and he literally gives me blanket responses while ignoring the content! So now I don't bother. I don't tell him if I'm ill. I don't tell him if I'm worried or upset or need support. Because he doesn't listen. And adding being ignored to the list just upsets me even more. 
Blimey I have ranted haven't I! and if you got to here my gosh I might never know you or speak to you but I am so thankful for you listening to me. I don't know why I wrote all this to be honest. but I've nowhere else to get it all out. and I'm hoping it may in some way help if someone else feels this? Especially today as we all sit watching people post their cards and flowers and posh meals out? 
maybe a 14 year old version of me might read this and manage to avoid becoming this trapped 40 year old version of me eh? 
Anyway. Thankyou for reading and I hope your day is starting with breakfast in bed amd not a lonely dark sofa.

Can someone have a chat,Sure,"Sure Bradley, what's on your mind?"
"We're told all out lives that WE are the problem. That we are clearly unstable and mentally ill and everything's soley blamed on that.  Then when we go to therapy we're told that due to past traumas or still ongoing toxic relationships (with others) our minds have been pretty much traumatised into reacting in this certain way. survival mode even. 
However we are still then made to retrain our minds because 'we clearly are making lives difficult for others'. I mean  'how dare we emotionally struggle in response to others being constantly mean to us'. Outside sources deny any wrong doing of course!.
We will always just be labeled as 'mentally unstable'. Technically we're actually abuse victims. Ignored and left to suffer alone for years. Our abusers are hidden within the false security like 'friends and family'. The dynamic causes us more confusion and turmoil. They however have had a constant shield to protect their ignorant, spiteful behaviour. They constantly gas light us into thinking we are the problem. They take zero responsibility yet demand 'we must go on medication' or that 'we must get therapy'. They would absolutely deny they've done anything wrong. THEY WILL ALWAYS JUST SAY ""YOUR PARANOID"" OR ""TOO SENSITIVE"". ""YOUR THE ONE WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES"". 
NO!
They are the real problem. 
Many people have commit suicide thinking that they are beyond broken. When in reality they've just been let down drastically by heartless fakes.
It's pretty sick when you think about it.

"I need a hug 🥹🥹 a lot of the times I feel so alone . And I keep replaying things in my head on how my life just went crazy . I really had a baby my a man that didn’t love me . I love my baby but it makes me go stir crazy on knowing that. Why didn’t I have enough self respect to stop messing with him . And I can’t ask for his help because he treats me like garbage. And it reminds me of how my dad used to treat me . I felt like nothing and for years I mourned not having a father . I tried to fix it , it made me so depressed I have been in counseling for yearsss . Even now I’m struggling , people make me feel so bad for being a single mom . My pregnancy was unsupportive I had maybe 1 or 2 people. And no one really came to my baby shower. and to think I will have to watch as people are supportive of my sister . I am hurting so much . It’s literally everyday . I don’t know how I can keep holding on .","Sorry it's not a real one, but sending a huge virtual huggggggggggg. People tell me hugs are like they wish they're husbands or loved ones would give them. :( shame I can't be out there giving them away, cause I need them also. 

Sorry for what your feeling, just be greatful you have this wonderful being in your life, something many of us have or will never experience. The father is a fool, try not to let him or others spoil the joy of being a mother. You have a reason to live and hopefully someone to look after you when your old. They'll be good times and bad, but that love or bond is priceless. You got this x",Take care and big hugs upon
Mental health sucks especially wen ur hearing voices every waking moment of every day since 2017 that's wots happened to me and I'm still hearing them now 😢 and they suck i can't be around people for to long or I'd have suicidal thoughts and hallucinations and i don't want that again the last time that happened was march of last year thanks to a fire i was put in emergency accommodation the whole flat was as the flat directly below me was on fire 🔥 i lost not only my home but all my stuff and was declared homeless that was the 4th time iv been homeless and its a scary place to be especially when you have mental health issues and trans each time I was homeless it was no fault of my own the 1st time was in 05 after me and the wife split up after nearly 15 years of marriage i was homeless for 3 months before being put in a hostel I was there for almost 6 months the second time was in 2017 in 2016 my second ex gf made me homeless bcus she was done with me as she wud beat me for being trans it goes so bad i was literally to scared to leave then in 2017 the hostel I was in made me homeless that was the 3rd time wen I moved in to my last flat in 2020 I didn't think I'd be homeless again but it happened sadly and lossing things each time iv been homeless is devastating bcus you have to start all over again and each time iv had to do that and it's exhausting to say the least then the end of march early April of last year i moved here they only thing this place as going for it is a shower and I'm literally around the corner from town I'm not even 60 seconds from town and each time I have to move my mental health gets hit hard when I moved here I was anxious and depressed for 6 months I suffer with eupd madd social anxiety and borderline bipolar and that's what makes me hear voices.,"You need to have your own home, no moving into others if poss, at least you have a long term home then",Take care of yourself.

Hi all so are  basically on this group because I suffer with mental health even though I'm starting to get better now I still have my down days but I am basically on here looking for for people to talk to or maybe be friends because I don't have many I been through a lot last year I'm only literally just putting myself back together but I would still like to talk to people bs something inside me is still telling me that I'm not right 🤔🤔,Just keep going. I have just finally been confirmed as bi polar. Every day just look for positive things even the smallest thing can change the way I look at things. I have hurt so many people through mental illness pushed them all away you have to look after number one. Keep positive,Take care x  I'm struggling too xx you can send me a nessage on messenger and maybe exchange numbers for mutual support x
Hi I’m getting increasingly worried as I’ve been getting back and side pains under ribs for the last couple of days. It’s been better today but now feels worse again. I’m taking Sertraline and Mirtazipine. I’ve googled and it didn’t calm me down…,Sometimes you can get those pains simply by sleeping in a weird position. If it's still there in a couple days just give the docs a call and see what they think.,Take hot bath and get good sleep dear
I’m so angry and upset. The drama group In my hospital are doing an exercise where we write our story and apologies and we film another person reading it out so we can hear and see our words in real life. I have filmed two people’s videos for them but no one will do it for me because of what I did. I used to be an internet troll but I’m not anymore I have changed and changing everyday. They just won’t help me.,Sending you hugs. You deserve a second chance and make one for yourself with new people learning from the mistakes made. #nesscares,Take it easy. People can be awkward. Persevere. Keep calm
"After a long conversation with with mental health going deep into what's happened in my life also another phone call today to finish what we started yesterday i found out that's its most likely I have ptsd, this came  as a massive shock as I didn't think it was possible as I always put everything down to life experience and tried to move on, on my own with no help or support, I didn't realise that years down the line it would rear its ugly head and destroy my life completely, and I am  completely devastated it took this long for me to seek help but I always put my mental needs after my childrens and everybody else's. So now for once I need to be selfish and do the hard work that needs doing. Not a road I really want to walk down, but a road that needs crawling down slowly, so after the tears yesterday the self haterd the anger I guess it's time to take the walk I don't want to do. Has anybody got any tips on how to cope with journey please","I am so proud of you for reaching out and getting help that's a massive step, u should be proud too. I have PTSd, my inbox is always open if u need anything x","Take that step buddy and see a professional so you can break everything down piece by piece. It takes time and courage coz it's a painful journey. I'm also suffering from ptsd, mdd,gad,pbd so you not alone at all."
"I lost a baby
I lost a job
I lost a girlfriend 
I started feeling sad during sunset times 
Then i started to feel insecure 
Suddenly, i started to feel like there's things or people following me
Then i startes having sleepless nights 
My ears started ringing
I developed loud noses
I got confused, i was just hearing noises not understanding where they come from.
Nothing was interesting anymore
I didn't enjoy the love life or friendships anymore
I just wanted to be alone yet when im alone i feel like im in the dark and there's this loud noises that keeps on
Pulling me further into darkness. 

Thanks to the antidepressants, although I  hate being reliable on medication., they really helped me find hope and feel strong again.","I'm not an advocate of too much med, but you sounded like you needed this to support for you to feel better and stronger after very  tough times.  I don't think a pill does it all you have a part to play , your doing so well and are stronger than you think, sorry for the stuff in your past ,look forward now,you've got this well done.",Take the medication. Nothing wrong with that. Be happy
"I'm alone almost all of the time. There have been so many things in my life spinning out of control.  I haven't really got any support. I'm looking for a church. I need prayer. I'm reaching out. I'm trying to talk to people I know but they are truly uninterested. I've recently received scary medical diagnosis. I'm having surgery in a little more than a week.  I'm scared. I can't sleep. I can't get my stomach to relax long enough. Any advice, words, positive vibes, prayers, to help me feel less alone.","I'm truly sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing. It takes courage to reach out. As you look for a church, remember that you're not alone, and seeking spiritual support is a positive step.

It's unfortunate that those around you may not be as responsive as you need them to be. Remember that people may not always understand the depth of your struggles, and it's okay to seek support from various sources.

Facing a scary medical diagnosis and upcoming surgery is undoubtedly tough. Surround yourself with positive influences, even if it means finding support beyond your immediate circle. Prayer and the strength of a community can make a difference.

In the meantime, focus on self-care. Practice deep breathing, listen to calming music, and engage in activities that bring comfort. I'm sending positive vibes and keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.","Talk to your healthcare team:
Share your fears and concerns with your medical team. They can provide information, answer your questions, and offer guidance on managing anxiety related to surgery.

Prioritize self-care:
Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and relaxation, such as meditation, gentle exercise, or listening to calming music.

Lean on friends and family:
While it seems like your current attempts to talk to people you know have been unproductive, consider reaching out again. Sometimes people may not fully understand the gravity of the situation, and a direct and open conversation can help.

Positive affirmations:
Remind yourself of your strength and resilience. Positive affirmations can help shift your mindset and provide a sense of calm. Repeat phrases that inspire hope and courage.

I'll be keeping you in my thoughts, and I truly hope that you find the support and strength you need during this challenging time."
How’s does everyone cope with crippling anxiety (without diazepam)????,"Leave the situation where the anxiety attack began, find (or imagine) something to focus on, whilst regularly taking slow, deep breaths","Talking to my therapist helps, but also finding a hobby you enjoy doing helps a lot. I do coloring, diamond painting, latch hook and cross stitch. Having that variety of activities helps me out a lot so if I'm not in the mood for one I'm usually in the mood for another."
"Hi everyone I’m Tanya. I have recently finished my level 2 certificate in counselling skills( I haven’t sat my exam this was meant to take place next month, but have finished the course) I am not a trained counsellor but I do have listening skills. My aim is to become a qualified counsellor. At a time of uncertainty we need to stick together. It’s so important to be able to talk and not live in our heads. All we can do is take things a day at a time, even when a day feels to longer break the hours down. I will be on hand for anyone that needs a chat. Remember you aren’t alone.Thank you.",A massive welcome to you!,"Tanya Wells you know this goes to you too.. Think we need to support each other through all of this 😘

"Good day please help people say I have a scary face, I'm unapproachable or looks serious, others say I always look like I'm sad or have recently had tragedic news. I think this has affected or has been a barrier in terms of connecting with other people. How do I get reed of this type of energy.","You need to learn to love yourself. Self-love is essential to light 💡 up
Inside.","Tbh others have to meet in the middle I would say society as a whole struggle socially, I think we've been trained out of it. Yet people as you know expect you to change.  Just be more open minded of a smile a hello see how people respond and go from there. Keep trying though and learn not to take too personal, everyone seems to have a lot on their minds,I don't think lockdown has helped."
"Hi all,I no im not the only 1 who feels so alone ,but it is a challenge alot of us face,I lost my partner and father of my 2 kids  to suicide 6 years ago....I did have family support at the time and now it seems no1 cares and I have no1....I no there over it n didn't affect them like it has me n there no longer there for me...I have probably 1 friend and my kids that's it...it's pretty shitty to feel so alone,I did the suicide walk 2 weeks ago and I did so well with my achievement,I no money is a worry now days but literally had 2 peoples sponsorship and wasn't till I mentioned all of my achievements and wanting to spread awareness that any1 cared,it really got to me and I haven't been the same since....I'm always the one to make effort with my family...I'm always the kind one who does everything and anything for anyone but feels I have no one....it can be so hard....sometimes I wonder why I bother and I no 100% I wouldn't be here if not for these kids,I do absolutely everything for them and I'm all they have....they aren't like most kids and have grandparent to take them places n be there for them....it's me and that's it....sorry fir the rant and thanks for listening","I hear u.   have you had any counselling for bereavement of your partner or cou selling to help . I'm not sure if you are under your gp but ask for help with services I.e money, free trips, bereavement group etc.  

You sound like a great mum who is isolated. 

Xxx you got this.  You sound like you need someone to talk to and some positivity.","Tbh there's a lot of fake care for mental health, however all those that suffer can ultimately change that and be there for one another.  If not do it for your little family, well done. And wishes for many good days and virtual hugs for the not so good. X"

Anybody here ?",Hi xxxx,"Tell me, I am listening"
"Just wondering - to any of those who suffer with anxiety or depression... if anyone is actually finding this lockdown a Positive thing?? 
(Just to give you some back ground I work in critical care in the NHS so am not completely locked down due to having to still work)...
Big big love to those who are struggling. But.... The pandemic has had the Opposite effect on me!! The less people and crowds around has eased my anxiety Massively., the less traffic on the road stopped my road rage; the slowing down completely of the whole pace of life has helped me stop my mind from constant cycling and my heart from constant racing; I feel a new sense of Peace that nature and the planet is healing due to the slowing down or stopping of our travel/pollution/industry; 
I have seen a level of kindness and generosity shown by humans that would not have happened had we not have been in lockdown. 
I am actually getting anxious and worried about coming Out of lockdown!! I’m not ready for it yet 😞","Great comment. Many of those who previously suffered anxiety are finding lockdown/isolation somewhat relaxing.  It's called the lockdown paradox. This is due to the new rhythm of life, collective conscious awakening of germ reduction, more downtime, extra sleep etc...which all bodes well for those who would otherwise suffer anxiety. Nice to see and hear.",Than you now understand I just if your suffering stop hit and have faith really understand that THE women thank for mind words and understanding written we all going through something but he strong find all talent and use it god is all is stay safe be kind

This is the first time I’m going to post without it being anonymous I was the guy who I went to my best friends funeral last week I’m not dealing with this at all I am broken in so many different ways each day is different to the next I honestly feel like I’m losing apart of me each and every day,I loss my son almost two years ago since he’s been gone I have felt numb thought why did he die and have she’d a lot of tears grief comes in waves according to my doctor I just wish I could have said I love you one more time he died in his sleep he was 43 when he died,Thank you all for the nice comments I really do appreciate it I have started a new hobby to help occupy my mind and it helps loads with my anxiety and depression
"I am struggling a bit today, my son has autism anxiety and learning disabilities, partner and myself has anxiety, partner has ptsd too.  i also have depression and i think it more deep down BPD. Both my partner and son are having a really bad day,  my partner just works continuously hardly see him, he popped in for about 20min today ( dont live together) and my son stays in his room only coming out to eat,drink and school. I  wanted to go out today  but didnt want to go out again on my own. Just feel so lonely today hate this feeling.  Good thing is i got a little job so i am hoping this will help my mental health ( already thinking of putting googly eyes on products, i need to joke if i dont i cry) and get me talking to people as only talk to my family and best mate on the phone due to them being 45min by car. And i dont drive. Normally i go it is what it is and try to ignore it but so hard today. I know why but cannot do anything about it. As my normal way of coping i cannot do. I need to find ways of coping better but have no idea where to turn.",Put an add up for meeting for a coffee in a local page online.

"Ok so ,I'm a born worrier, & my anxiety and Panic attacks have come back,especially when it comes to the shopping, because I'm a creature of habit,""makes me feel less worried about things"" but I cant follow my weekly routine as there isn't what I need to get In the shops,I know I will manage, just feels like my head wont ! Does that make sense?
I worried about my children not being at school as I'm not the best at school things, & you see all these posts about all these brilliant parents who are going to keep school routines, the school routine is why I make myself presentable & leave the house. My children are going to really suffer,& they are my top priority,  sorry for the long post,& it being all over the place.Feel like I cant say this anywhere else as I'm the mum & support alot of family .","Amanda, you being there for your children is enough. It’s not all about the learning, the extra cuddles and love through out the day is the most important. Remember what we all see and read on Facebook isn’t alway reality.

"I'm here honestly for who ever wants to reach out, but there are a few on here to extort on our vulnerability,just be careful people x",We do our best to spot those who are abusing the nature of this group. If you feel another member is actively doing this please report to us...,"Thank you for the honest words! 

It is absolutely essential for people to keep themselves safe, first and foremost.

If anything seems off or questionable in any way, it is always best to be careful and to not engage with the person or organization who is asking for information or payment. 

You have shared honest and important information. I hope that people can listen and heed your advice. 

I stand by my offer of help, if anyone needs it. I promise that I am genuine and that I am committed to supporting my fellow human beings. 😊❤️"
"After about 2 years of psychotherapy I feel as if I've turned a corner.  I'd like to share my 13 keys to being happy, or at least happier and less anxious/depressed:

1. Respect other people's opinions even when you don't agree, or understand how they could have that opinion.

2. Stop watching television news, except local news.  Read national news from various sites instead.

3. Work on improving yourself and not trying to change those around you.

4. Quit worrying or having anxiety about things in which you have no control and/or won't affect you directly.

5. Stop worrying about being right and focus on being happy.  

6. Debate but don't argue on social media (learn the difference)

7. Don't insult or denigrate anyone at any time.  You may be right but that doesn't mean you don't experience anxiety even when you are.

8. Respect elders, even when you disagree.

9. Be a positive person publicly, work on your negativity privately. 

10. Do more things that make you happy, no matter what they are, and be a little selfish on occasion and do something nice just for you.  

11. When something in the news makes you very angry or upset, focus on why, it's possible, or even likely, that you are actually hurt or upset about something else in your life that you're not addressing. 

12. Enjoy and focus on being present in the moment, not constantly regretting the past or worrying about the future.  

Lastly:

13. Try to really listen to people when they speak to you instead of thinking about yourself or what you are going to say next..","Excellent advice for all, and is just the way I've been living (to the best of my ability)🙏 hope it serves you as it has me.",Thank you for this! 💜
"Whenever I post about loss I’ve endured, I hope it doesn’t sound like I’m comparing myself to anyone else b/c I’m not. We all have our story. With that said…
They gave my dad 2-4 months, stomach cancer, it spread to his vital organs. Put everything in order, that’s it. Finally the Dr said he’d run a scan to see if surgery could buy a little time, but probably not.
Next week, the Dr stuttered, can’t explain it, but now it’s only in the stomach, let’s do surgery. It worked! Eight days later, Wednesday, mom and I brought him home! My parents were happier than I’d ever seen them. 24 hours later, I got an emergency call… possible stroke. I finally reached my wife, who was with my parents.
She said no, he’s fine… but my mom had the stroke. Sadly she didn’t survive - it doesn’t stay this sad, but 1 day into my dad’s recovery, instead of their new lease on life, this happened. He lived another 7 years, and did well during that time. Why tell this? Because months later, I discovered a different story.
The other story I discovered is that the week before my mom passed was truly sweet - the I love you’s were said, the family was all closer than ever. Had my mom passed without that precious week, my dad would have lived with deep regret. This changed everything for me.
The story we tell is where we find meaning, and we get to choose how we tell it. The best stories often have the darkest moments. Find the precious story and tell it with all your heart - especially to yourself.","If you're struggling with mental health, having someone listen to you is very important. If you don't feel like you can trust your loved ones, that can be really hard to deal with—especially when it comes to talking about your mental health journey.
If this sounds like something that's going on in your life, make sure you reach out! I am here for you.",Thank you for your story. Inspirational
"Well I want to share my story with everyone. When I was 19 I made a suicidal attempt and jumped off the well known railroad tracks known to never stop for anything, off of a bridge roughly over 60 feet high. During the process I had a police officer negotiator with me on the bridge. When I jumped I fell so hard I did not feel the surface of water.  But the bottom of the rocks crashing into my body. Bottom of river. I swam to the surface and layed on my back watching the night stars till a lifeboat lights hit my head. I screamed as they pulled me out of the river had hypothermia from ice cold waters and standing till night on the bridge in middle of May. 

Ever since I went through heights of terror with mental health and system in general and trying to cope and heal from the life's experience. 

I am 31 now during the progression of the years I fell homeless in city streets. Thought I'd never see a good thing in my life.

Now im housed by professionals that care for me greatly. I have phycologists, nurses, phschiarists, therapists of all kinds that visit me weekly for my care. It's been hell. But I've managed to be beneficial to community by volunteering efforts.

I still struggle have pain that's still there could possibly be there for the rest of my life. But everyday I do something for myself on this journey. I've buildt art and archives of photos I love from aspects of what I decided to document. 

So I hope everyone knows that life does care. Have a wonderful day or night.",I love your story and I am so glad you are able to encourage others so powerful.,Thank you for your story. My heart goes out to you. I too have suffered crippling depression.
"Hi, I've been on Setraline for three weeks now after having taken citalopram for almost 12 years. I found citalopram had stopped working and as a result I'm back to suffering severe anxiety and depression again. I've found Setraline has made me feel worse in terms of anxiety and depression but I'm told to persevere for another 4 weeks for the drug to take an effect. I've had possibly one good day where I felt 75% myself, however, the next day I felt worse again. I'm not sure what I'm asking in terms of support from this group but I suppose some reassurance that I'll be okay would be nice to hear.  Also, before I tried citalopram, I was depressed for years and years and have tried every type of therapy to help overcome it. I just wish it was something I cough conquer, God knows I've tried but I suppose I have to put it down to a chemical imbalance.",Is those medications the brand names I am not familiar with them is a bummer changing medications I sure hope the new medication works for you I know it takes time  check to see if there is an outpatient program you can go to the program is a three days a week three hours. a day I hope you have a therapist ask your doctor or therapist if something like that exists somewhere near you I attended the program for ten months finished in September have faith in God never give up your worth it,Thank You Gayle - beautiful soul ❤️
"Hi all ,Help.not looking for sympathy
Had enough of feeling like this and just do not know what way to turn, not on any meds.i feel so unsettled in mind  constanf questioning thoughts most of the time. feel as if I am losing it it doesn't matter whether I am sitting or doing anything .cannot use any distraction techniques not working. tv,gardening,music ,meditation, drawing, reading,ect as I cannot take anything in.just want to sit down. have been losing cooking skills ,composing shopping list ,shopping ,getting out .cutting myself off does not help but cannot help as mind feels so bad.

"I am drinking too much. This is not an easy admission to make. Drinking seems to obliterate the permanent thoughts in my head. I have been lying to my GP and some others including my son. I know that I am an alcoholic  but I don't really want to seek help as I will lose the only way I can cope. I am fighting a personal battle with booze and, so far, I have got nowhere. I haven't be honest with son, whom I am very close to. I feel like a failure. I have been fighting depression for nearly 50 years and I am sick and tired with it. I know that there is no hope of me to get any better any time soon. Thank you for letting me have a rant. All the bes",Go on a on line support for drinking.  Then you don’t have to worry about right now going for help in a class. But. Start somewhere. Like maybe don’t drink tell like after 5 go for walks with your son or your pet in the afternoon .,"Thank you so much all for the love and support. I am trying to be strong but so much crap has happened in the last 2/3 years that I feel like I am losing my sanity some days. I have taken a step back to look at who I have become and, I have nothing to look back on and be proud of, maybe apart from doing a degree with the Open University over a periodof 5 years. My son was present at my Graduation ceremony which meant the world to me. I had achieved something I thought was impossible. I owe it, not only for myself,  but also the friends who supported throughout my studies. I want to be a better person and be kinder to myself which I find near on impossible. Anyway, thank you again. In my isolated little world (I am physically disabled as well), it means more than you could imagine. I don't think that the people, who have never suffered from mental health issues, understand how crippling it can be some days."

My lad had a mental breakdown weekend just gone he wanted to end his life  by sitting on a bridge ready to jump. We seen a doctor yesterday and he going to get mental health nurse involved. Any advice he had 2 hours sleep last night. Doctors don't want to put him on medication. As a parent it's not what you want to hear . Any advice be great,Can they not give him diazepam to settle him so he can try and relax it will help until the mht step in worth a askx,Thanks all mental health team rang today they are doing a call on Monday with emergency team . Thanks all your advice xx
How do I overcome not wanting to do anything? I spend most of my day laying on my bed playing with my phone. I've zero interest in getting up. I'm already on 150mg sertraline daily for my depression .,Im the same I lie in bed most days.  Just don’t want to get up and deal with life xx,Thanks everyone for your support. I ve been dragging myself out to activities so am coping better.
Anyone have advice on how to survive working at home with your thoughts?  I get stuck on certain things in particular my relationship and spiral when I am home working alone.  Also definitely have a problem with ruminating.  It is just getting really tiring,Music and having a dance party by your self!,"Thanks for sharing and asking for help! Here is something I did and it helped me. I put in mandatory (do not skip) breaks in my calendar. During this time I walk around the block, the apartment or the garden. Do not think about the things you need to do after the break. Look at things you see and let your mind take it all in. It doesn't happen in a day or two, but after a week, I felt like I was part of the world"
"Well I'm new to this..well iv been struggling with mental health for a few years now. I was in a relationship for the past 8 years and over that time i was mentally, emotionally and physically abused. Well it's all finally came to an end in my relationship but I moved to a place were I'm very isolated have no friends or family around me. Feeling very lost within myself very alone. Hoping to have support from here.","Been through same thing. Support groups on here are a blessing. Of course if you need a chat just post on here, your never alone pal","Thanks for sharing and asking for help! It is not easy to share. I am happy that you decided to move on and stuck to your decision. As adults, it is more difficult for us to meet people and make friends. It is worse, if you are an introvert or have trust issues. I would recommend using meetups to go and meet people. Maybe you don't talk to anyone the first few times, no pressure. But get used to having people around. Soon, when you feel ready, maybe you would talk to someone or who knows, someone might come talk to you. And always, use this group to share, talk. I am here and listening"
"IMPORTANT: this is just a vent/rant post i am safe: 

TRIGGER WARNING: mention of ABA :

am not well. just trying to find any way i can to manage without relying on the as needed meds. as i don't want to get reliant on them. my mom wants me to just take the meds every time i even begin have intrusive thoughts. she doesn't understand that the meds are potentially addictive and that i only have a limited number of them.

the tapering  off of a med  is going ok. even though it's messing with what way round i have my days and nights. the taper off has also brought up some sensory needs that where   suppressed for years. i have it figured out🤞🏻. and my adult sized pacifiers(yes that is a thing) should  be in on wednesday. no i'm not into adult baby/little kink. am literally getting the pacifiers so i don't continue sucking my thumb to the point of skin issues. 

the biggest problems with my mom is her disrespect and disregard for my sensory needs. her whole view on the topic is that i never had sensory issues for 30 years why now that i have a diagnosis of autism does that change ""suddenly"". 

it's like no they have always been there. they were just forced to be suppressed because  they were seen as inappropriate behaviour and acting out. that was suppressed primarily with antipsychotics medication from the age of 12. along with the use of intentional or unintentional TRIGGER WARNING STARTS HERE:

ABA(applied behaviour analysis)
ABA is in very simple terms a person does what you tell them to exactly how you tell them to it that person gets rewarded for being compliant. it's a very damaging practice that is a BIG no with in the neurodivergent community. often is a cause of trauma",Your mom sounds like mine a controlling person. Lol. We change always regardless if your 30 years old sometimes toxic people make us worse sometimes the right person makes it better. Notice your self worth because it is not something anyone can justify its how you feel about your health and yourself. Be easy on yourself and you will make appropriate actions to get you where your meant to be in life.,Thanks for sharing your a very brave person. I also have a mom with control issues and I am only 56. Lol. I also don’t take my medication but I don’t have the same diagnosis as you. Praying for you 🙏😇
"I have been suffering from mental illness for quite some time about 20 years. Recently in the last 18 months I have developed I guess 3 new voices to go along with my regular 3 that I’ve had for the past two decades. Thes voices are much different there definitely foreign like English would be there second language and they make very rude comments about my wife having sexual indescrepancys with them and other men, it starting with them saying they were forcing her to do these things and now has turned into them saying ur wife is a freak we don’t have to force her to do anything she likes to do these things. The voices come n go and aren’t constant. Many years ago I was diagnosed  with skitzoaffective disorder. Along with ptsd and bi polar. The voices are loud and clear and seem very real in my home is usually the only place I seem to hear them as if there coming through the vent or by my tv from a miniature speaker. I have tried talking to my wife about this and she gets very upset. So I’m asking is it possible or likely for me to develop new voices like this are could someone possibly really be missing with me hardcore? Or is this likely really happening they have even went as far as talking bout kidnapping my wife and selling her to sex traffickers! This is almost to much for me to handle I’m at my wits end and really confused, it seems real to me. But I also suffer from mental illness. I am asking for advice and personal input for my situation, going for now lost in LA Jay.",im also bipolar with psychosis i know how hard it is u think the voices are real or its part of u reality try to take CBT it helps to cop with voices and how to ignore them think of them different i strongly recommend u CBT and DBT to be more mindful,Thanks for the feedback although no one has answered the question I asked about how likely am I  to develop new voices on a factual basis?
"Sorry to post this but going through a terrible time. There's nobody to support me, nobody to reach out to. The worst thing is that even if I did have a 'loving family' I don't really know I'd I could put into words what's wrong.

I have always been down on myself but I had a really bad experience in the summer. I was homophobically abused in my own apartment by a family member. 

Now every time I look in the mirror I feel physically sick! I'm so ugly, fat, horrible and a freak!!

I just wanted to rant, it's hard keeping this inside.

I hope this ends soon",Hope you feel better soon,Thanks I just want to stop hearing the voice inside my head telling me I'm a fat loser
‼️NEVER GIVE UP‼️,hope,Thanks Momma!

Not sure if I've done this But Happy New Year one and all.,You too 🙂,Thankyou and the same to you
"Hi my names Ian and I’m new to the group, I’m diagnosed schizoaffective.

What I want to do here is share my story, and let you know there is a light at the end of this tunnel which is possible through pure strength of will that I know everyone of us has within us. My condition surfaced at 9 years old, this was the result I know due to being groomed by a peadophille.
I was very much an innocent child, I built dens, I played with toys just as a someone younger than 10 should. Unfortunately what happened, well happened, it should never have but it did. It went on for months and my voices presented themselves initially to protect me from what was happening.  Initially I started with five, one woman and four men. Overtime they changed, they became hostile towards me, very aggressive, they’d pull me down and attempt to destroy me.

As I got older the mood aspect of my disorder began to show, initially just a bit more up or a bit lower than I should be,  it these began getting more and more extreme. As expected when presenting my moods with my gp I was diagnosed depressed. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to share about my voices as I had an agreement, an nda so to speak with them, so I suffered in silence. 
During all of this I met a wonderful woman called Laura, we moved in together, we married and got on with life. 

My voices would continue to effect me, at one point making me forget my wife’s name for months at a time, forcing me to use pet names as unable to speak hers.  

As the years went on I deteriorated further, this led to a diagnosis of bipolar and in and out of mental health facilities within Nottinghamshire.  During my time within ward b2 in Worksop they discovered my voices and was able to diagnose correctly and medicate me effectively to a point. I was tested on a wide range of antipsychotics, increasing in dose with more and worsening side effects, but eventually found the winning combination. Quetipine 800mg Slow release a day, 25mg quick release for episodes happening 3 to 4 times a day, 400mg of carbamazepine and my antidepressant mirtazipine. 

I’ve always been a relatively big lad but with this winning combo I was around 18 stone in weight. 
In 2021 on march the 6th my wife died. It was our 17th wedding anniversary that day. There was errors made by the paramedics that day, and her heart stopped in my arms and she died there and then. This became the worst day of my life, the trauma gained me three new voices, another very aggressive male and two children. My dosage of antipsychotics increased to a total of 1200mg a day after what happened.  

In our marriage we had a split of responsibilities, Laura cooked and I cleaned, and that worked perfectly, after she passed I had not a clue of where to start, so resorted to being a microwave technician, and a bad one at that. I ballooned further in weight to 22 stone. I’d given up, so you know what I’m saying there. One day in September 2021 I had a pizza or something in the oven, at this point I could figure that out, I was sat on the sofa and started feeling pressure on my chest, this ran into my left arm and to my jaw, at that point I knew what was happening, so I tossed my phone away. Around 45 min I came around, and I realised I don’t want to go yet, I’m 41 years old I’ve a whole life ahead of me if I want it, and dam it I wanted it. When I felt strong enough (should have called 999 at this point but didn’t, I know I’m an idiot!) I walked into the kitchen, I got the bin bags and I cleared my entire kitchen out, coffee, chocolate, ready meals everything. That. night I didn’t eat.

The following day I went shopping, I went and bought green veg and lots of it, chicken and fish and loads of water.  And this was the beginning of my recovery. I ate smaller portions of only things I cooked, no fats, no sugars, no carbs, no caffeine, I went as natural a diet as I could. I started leaning how to cook and found a passion. Each week I lost around 9lbs a week. Within 4 weeks of this new lifestyle I came off antidepressants after 16 years, in 3 months I’d stripped over 7stone of body weight.. With the assistance of my psychiatrist and my psychiatric nurse I lowered my antipsychotics.  
I felt the best I’d ever felt. It’s coming up to 2 years since Laura passed, I’m the best I’ve ever been in my life, on a quarter of the meds I was on, I’m focused, determined, I’m just over 13 stone I weight which I’ve kept off, and I’m a bloody good cook.  I’ve met a beautiful woman who I’m more than happy to tell you I’m madly In love with.

I’m not saying I have a cure, because I don’t, but right now I can walk out the door, I can go to work, I can walk through crowds of people, I can talk openly about what my voices try to tell me to do, and I’m back in control.  What I am saying is you have a choice, you can choose you path, you can change your life if you want to, and you are not defined by your condition.  There’s a light, you just have to want to reach for it!

I apologise for this novel of a post, but I wanted to share positivity and hope!

#makepositivechanges #eathealthy #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #domore #positivevibes #weightloss #actdontreact","An inspiration! That's what you are!  I don't usually read such long posts but, you got me in from the very beginning. I'm so glad you found the best of you. Keep on keeping on!!❤",Thankyou for sharing it's wonderful to know of someone who has faced dark times and through perseverance created change. You found a way beyond mere existence to experience and participate in life. X
I don't know what's wrong with me. I was dealing with  narcissistic abuse and some reason I'm feeling guilty for finally standing up to his bs..it's like even when someone hurts me I still feel empathy for them and blame myself,You don’t have to feel that way and a healing spell is what needs to be done for you so that you can stop been empathy,That behavior of yours looks symptomatic of trauma bonds. You might need therapy to get over that.
This is a huge achievement for me especially with how much I have been struggling recently!!! Just remember it is ok not to be ok and your not alone no matter what feelings are valid and mental health matters healing is a step to recovery every step every day every minute counts this is why I have never given up because I know that I am stronger than my mind and I can take on anything if I set myself a goal I am proud of myself even if other people aren’t this is a big achievement in my life and I am strong to keep going. ❤️‍🩹,That's awesome!!!  I'm so proud of you!!,That is a brilliant achievement well done 😊
"My partner of 25 years ended our relationship 4 days ago, then he tells me last night that he's met someone else and they are going to 'give things a go' (he spent the night at her house 2 days after break up)  .. its broken me, how can he move on that quick, i obviously meant nothing to him. I'm so lost and alone","Sorry your going through this. I know you won't want to hear this but he was obviously seeing her whilst he was with you. My dad did the same to my mom.
Just know that you can do better and what he has done to you will come back on him tenfold","That is really tough, I have been with mine thirty years almost so can understand what a massive thing. The signs that things weren't right may have been there for a while. You need to give yourself time and space to get over before you can even think of another relationship. Hold on to the good things that you had and don't dwell on the negative as I think that was a real achievement in itself to have a relationship for so long. Be kind to yourself."
It's so wrong a person with paranoia and mental  health will only get help off the mental health nurse if that person does harm to her self or others so wrong  💯💯,You just go to your GP and hospital for help,That person sud get help before they do harm
"Thought this tune was appropriate at this time were all in, have a good day and zoom away everyone, ☺ 💕 🎶 🎶 ☺🎶",,That song does really cheer you up thanks Flo x
"I forgot when I last posted but since then I’ve been good but today my brain is all crazy wondering “when the bad moment will come?”

“This is all fake” 

“I don’t feel real” 

“The storm will hit me soon” 

Stuff around me started weird today so I’m very anxious things will be messed up kinda started last night as always when aunt called mom on the phone and trauma dumped her and stuff got tense cuz she was acting off 

I’m so ugh….",I get the same thing  or old memory's of bad happenings that i have probably fantasised . Like people bracking in to my home or people playing pranks on me .,"That's absolutely normal Mandy. I know it's contrary to popular opinion but....
If you have had a really bad time, and every time you have picked yourself up things have gone bad again, in a way you come to expect a bad outcome, so when things are good for longer than expected, you start to expect that bad outcome to happen. 
And you're right, it is anxiety. And it is something that you need to cope with and overcome because when you finally get life so it is good for you, you don't want to self-sabotage any chance of happiness you may have."
Saturday I got a letter from capquest about a 713 bill from 2011 to do with littlewoods Catalogue i said to the woman I've no clue to what she is talking about because i don't i did say that from 2011 to 2016 i had no letters or anything from them because if I did I'd never of got a letter from capquest but because i didn't Receive anything from littlewoods it wouldn't surprise me if it was my second ex gf that did it then put it in my name because that's the kind of person she is.,"If Yoo haven't paid anything at all in this bill for 6 years or more then it is statute barred.
This means that no recovery action can be taken against you at all.
Just call them and say it's statute barred and that they must not contact you again or pass it on.
I had someone knock on my door two weeks ago for a bill from 1999.
He was unaware of its age and when I told him he left very quickly",That's not true I worked in debt recovery. You don't have to pay it and it shouldn't show on your credit file. They have every right to contact you although most won't as no value.
thought this would make us all smile,Thanks,that's ok as long as it made you smile
New year same shit when will it end,"Reach out to cosmos_remedies on IG, explain to him what you are suffering and wait for his recommendation.he helped me out.",That's what I wrote on my statue this morning
"If you like walking and talking and would like to change your life this is definitely for you!

"Pt. 2 

Thanks everyone that commented and made suggestions about what to do. I have made a doctors visit about my hand and I told them about my mental health. They hey have scheduled me an appointment with a psychiatrist that they recommended me to be a good fit. And they told me that what I am doing is a big step towards recovery. I want to thank everyone who gave me advice and I told my foster parents about what is going on. They fully support about what I want to do and they took my phone and cut contact of my girlfriend who is now my ex. They said that they are proud of me for talking to them about it and even offered me help with anything I need. No questions asked. I feel blessed that all of you and my foster parents support me and I cant even described all of your support. I will be posting updates every now and then, but I will keep updating.",Well done you have best support,"That’s great news Zach!   So happy for you!  Especially that your foster parents are giving you all the support and help you need.

Makes me so happy!"
i am done with my life noone wants to help me whats the point anymore?😔,"before you seek help from anybody, are you ready to help yourself and care your own body and soul and mind?
defend yourself, if nobody helps, you can start helping yourself self-care is the best care.",The fact that you’re even writing it means there is a point
How do you avoid negative thoughts,"You don't. You acknowledge them, understand what they signify and correct the situation.","The first step to modifying an unhealthy pattern is to recognize and name the problem that's maintaining it: automatic thoughts. Knowing that an automatic thought is bringing you down can be a big relief.

Once you've named the problem, it becomes much easier to analyze it and find a solution."
Hi I'm in need of some advice/help don't even no what to call it... Iv been going thru depression n anxiety for sometime now to tho point were iv tryed to take my own life n got worse since I suddenly lost mum in August as iv never been good at much I am good at cooking and really enjoy it so I had a idea to give me sumat to focus on and better my self n get a certificate sumat to be proud of ya no..

And it made me feel like shit to the point were am in tears heartbroken kinda am crying while writing this post.. I feel like a failure before iv even started.. I was on such a high just to be n feel put down by someone who suppose to love me.. My partner says am over reacting she don't see she's said or done owt rong.. So am thinking am I over thinking things or wot... Need help/advice owt....

Xxx,The fundamental delusion - there is something out there that will make you happy and fulfilled forever.
"When I hate feeling like im drowning,  yet cant seem to get the support, care, love or understanding from family.  

I hate how my dad is yet am getting to the point im not letting it gey to me as much,  good or bad im blocking my emotions towards him. Couse bad things happen. 

Mum doesn't believe anything is wrong even after reading my journal,  finding oit i spent the first 3 months of the year off my antidepressants,  deep thoughts,  selfharm,  not coping.  Yet days after saying I had problems im not alone says that i there is nothing wrong and im doing it to myself. 

Mentally,  im drowning in silence.  Emotionally i bottle up afraid to show. Socially I dont have friends or go out. 

Mental health will be the end of me.  I need help too afraid to get it alone.","While it's important to feel like you need to block those emotions caused by those people, it's more important to change your response to those emotions. Not block them, bury them etc. Unresolved powerful emotions that we try to bury or block will cause damage from the inside. Depression, stress, anxiety will all increase. I was like this. I'm not an emotional person, never really have been. I bottled up everything because I thought that was the man thing to do. It was the most miserable time in my life. It almost cost me my life, twice. You are the most important person. To yourself. Before anyone else. Gaurd your mental health like it's the most valuable treasure you have. I'm in a far better place mentally. It's a daily challenge and struggle sometimes. But I'm not a victim anymore. I want to survive and commit myself to do that. You can do the same.",The longer you hold it in the harder you will fall when you get so overwhelmed and fall apart it may be a good idea to go back on medication and maybe therapy
"This is my first post, hello all. I find my thoughts/world view alien to most people making me feel like the alien. I'm not looking for advice or understanding because my mind like all of yours is a complicated labyrinth. To be listened to is all's I want at this moment. I'm here because I don't know where else to turn, I distrust the medically assigned minders of the mind because they study from books and don't have first hand experience or knowledge of what they are talking about. So this is my introduction, Hello.","Very true trust your gut, don’t give up on yourself!",The medically assigned minders are largely under the control of big pharma..once you realise this it sets you out and people think you’re strange!
"I'm hoping someone can help me out with this one xx

Long shot but the doctor has prescribed me some medication they've told me I need to give it a week to kick in, but it's taking my anxiety over the roof! I now see people putting there heads up to my windows and it's proper freeking me out! 

This started around 5 days ago at a small level now I'm currently laid in bed with my curtains closed, do I trust them and give it until Monday when they reopen or what else can I do? It only happens in the dark though but there in the street to! I had to break hard this morning to what I thought was a peacock in the road, when I got closer it was a witch that disappeared I could have caused an accident, don't worry I'm not driving at night ever again!",Which medication?  Do they have an after hours line to call and talk to a nurse?,The meds most likely hasn't kicked in or is not for you
"I cannot understand how difficult is to get mental health treatment in the UK no matter how many people you speak to unless the patient try’s to end their life there is no specific support unless the clients asks for it ?????

She has to literally attempt suicide  before anyone will believe her ?????????","The UK falls flat on its arse for supporting mental illness - I’ve lost to many friends through it due to lack of or no support at all.

When my mum died in her arms in December (the 30th) we tried to call help lines on the 31st and everyday for over two weeks after and never got to speak to anyone!",The mental health team and emergency services failed my family 2 weeks ago. We called for help several times and it took 3 hours for them to get to us. In which time my husband and father of our 6 year old daughter took his own life 💔 we are broken and I feel so let down by those that are meant to help. It's awful it really is. I hope you get the support ❤️
,"Very lonely, working from home is beginning to take it toll. 😷☹️",The news r crap so don't watch it
"Hello I’m new here I was wondering if I could ask for some advice please? Long story short during the last two years I’ve lost everything mainly my fault due to cocaine addiction, I’m at rock bottom now, the doctors have suggested anti depressants and adhd medication but I don’t know what to do, the last thing I need is to get hooked to those as well

Thanks",These drugs are to balance the chemicals in your brain. Completely different. They've saved my life. Best wishes 🙂,"The only thing I lost was my mind, I gave the rest away."
"i haven’t showered, changed clothes or taken my meds for a week… 

it’s really bad i know but i literally haven’t had the energy and quite frankly haven’t cared one bit… 

tomorow i am going to try my hardest to shower and get into fresh clothes, i just need to get back on track with my meds😭 i feel disgusting.. 

why have i been this way? how do i not let this happen again and stop it!",Take it easy!,"The only thing you can do is take your time, your body is putting you in limp mode, as it feels you need to recover first,  I know to can't be helped but the more you feel upset/bad it makes you worse, maybe start simple strip wash, but even if it's just getting out of bed it's a start"
"People want me to go to group therapy this is one of the reasons I don't want to go, bcus the therapist will only want to talk about the past something i don't want to talk about bcus it brings up really bad memories that I'd rather not relive bcus they are that bad I'm not going to say wot bcus i don't want people feeling sorry for me or pity.","Ok so you don't want to group therapy and talk about the past. That could be cool 😎
BUT... let's talk about the present - if you could press that magic button and bring peace to you - what would be different about you tomorrow?",The only way to leave the past in the past is to go through it.
"Can I ask you all a question and I would really appreciate the honest no bs answers. I am in a fairly new relationship. 4 months or so. On the whole extremely happy but little snippets of my partners past keep coming to light (sexual things, ex partners ect). Now I always thought we were very open and honest to each other but when asked about these past things my partner denies them and later on tells me the truth. Now I understand we all have a past, jesus I have one but I've always been honest about it so it cant come back to bite me and I am unable to comment on these past events ect because it was before my time but am I right to feel like shite about it and kinda a feeling of betrayal. I feel sick and cant sleep. It's making me look at her in a different way. I'm really struggling!!",Mate I think you may be overthinking the whole thing. It doesn’t really matter what yours or your partner’s background was just enjoy each other and leave the past in the past and look forward to a happy relationship in the future.,The past is in the past but you also learned some powerful lessons boundaries are important let your experiences guide you in your relationships but also remember people do make mistakes

"from : 

“i feel so lonely, there’s no one texting me”

I feel depressed and mentally down I just need someone I can talk for some moments 😢,Here for you,There are days when I am cleaning house shopping spending a lot of money just feeing happy then there are days I can feel the sadness I feel more comfortable at my house than anywhere else  know in my mind this will not last I pray because i havre faith but sometimes I don’t have the energy so I just wait and let God

"I wanna socialize more

Any tips how I can be more talkative to people? I wanna engage in conversations but I get awkward 

Also any tips how to freely socialize get out of my comfort zone without getting myself hurt? 

Thanks","Hi, there are ways of getting yourself into conversations, and to practice the various skills necessary.
One of the defining factors is experience in the world. 

The age of someone wanting to start to gain confidence in meeting people and start conversations - will depend on the solution.",There is no way to avoid getting hurt unfortunately but don't let that stop you from finding friends. Good luck on your journey!
Why are people online so abusive or just to me?,"Hey, what's been said to you?",There is plenty of good people out there just ignore the bad xx
Why am I getting these intrusive thoughts? Sometimes there isn't a reason behind them.,There's a chemical imbalance that causes them. But no doctor is going to tell you that only try you on different medications until one works.,"There isn't. The mind just picks it up. You then got involved.

Do the practice ""Inner Engineering"".

hi dus eny won no of eny numbers for Sport who can help me with my mental health I am in a bad way it dus not meen I am going to do eny think just need to talk to someone plees can sumwon send me a private message,"The samartians are the only 24 hour thing in the UK nationally there number is 116123 

If you google / look local to where you are, there will likely be another number or 2? They'll be more of a local mental thing normally. Not sure everywhere has them, but know we do here in Warwickshire and its 24 hour, only problem is tho your only allowed 20 mins a day. 

Mind also often do drop in sessions and sometimes 121 stuff, so definitely worth an ask. Again I know my local mind has a drop in service from 7 till 11 every evening. 

Otherwise search for other local charities, a lot of them have popped from individuals who needed support like us, but found little there.

They are often called cic's (comunity interest companies) there almost everywhere also. U hey might help, maybe Google search mental health cic and your location or on fb. Might take a bit of hunting, but they'll be something somewhere.

Hope that helps, stay strong my man.",There’s always someone listening🙏🙏🙏

"I need help. My son has a rage problem. He is 22 and is married to a very sweet girl. When they fight she shuts down and it triggers rage in him. He has never hit her, that I know of but has done things like hold her down and I fear for her safety because these things only escalate. He used to get this way with his sister when they lived at home but I didn’t think it was a real issue because he never did it in front of me. I thought it was just sibling stuff that he would grow out of. Looking back that might have been naive or even negligent on my part. What can I do to get him help now?

"Hi everyone

Considering the fact that people in the UK, particularly in London, are depressed and anxious, where does it come from exactly?

In my opinion, there's one factor which is our schooling system. I'm not here to raise any propaganda or controversy. But to find a root cause and fix it.

The reason I could mention for such an opinion is recruitment of more female teachers and staff and having a co education system. I'm not against women empowerment at all. 

All I want to say is that the co education system should be limited till a certain age group, like until 7 or 8 max. 

Boys need male role models and girls need female role models. 

As per my observations, boys and even men have adapted feminine nature. People are overprotecting/under protecting their kids, which is destructive for their future. 

I believe that boys need male role models in schools to groom properly and get well nurtured. 

Don't you think our schooling system should change? 

What's your opinion?

I'm open to criticism, but within boundaries because this is a genuine concern.","Not only in London it’s other countries too and some schools in other countries kids get beaten up by teachers so UK is best to be honest depression happens to anyone young old due circumstances family, financial, or just mind that can’t handle problems needs human help.",This is a interesting topic you raise. I also heard that there are a lot of people drinking drug taking and bed hopping too out here which is worse than what you have just suggested. It is our upbringing following our surrounding that makes us who we are. At the end of the day.
"give my mam £300 rent a month (i’m on pip as i can’t work right now due to my anxiety,ocd,bpd and physical illness…

She lent £75 from me a few days ago (this is a regular thing) and i told her just to give me £50 back as she needs gas electric etc.. which is fine as i don’t mind helping.. 

however , she’s asking to lend more money for ‘Christmas’ and because i said i’m not comfortable with it she’s speaking to me like this…. have i done something wrong or is she trying to manipulate me?! This is a monthly thing with her and it really triggers me and sets me off, i can’t handle it😭😭😭","Her lack of poor financial planning is not your issue. Christmas is the same date every year, she’s had plenty of time to budget accordingly. Stick to your guns.","This is financial abuse.  You should stop lending, start saving where she never finds out about it and leave.  If you have a support worker, bring them into this, keep the evidence and get help"
"A joke for everyone.
Last night someone broke into my car and stole my anti depressents...... I hope there happy now.",That’s pitiful,This is genuinely funny🤣
"I am so sad and broken ,lost and just empty ..

My mum has mental health issues .. and she treats me like I’m just not enough all the time. She wants me to be and do a particular thing and it’s not me and even if I tried and achieved what she wanted is still be a disappointment.

Everyone told me to just block my mum out and never. Talk to her again . 
 Her actions have made me so mentally unwell . 

But then there is the guilt .. 
I’m worried that when she dies I will regret blocking her out and I carry that on my shoulders daily. 

But I have to protect my children from her actions they see me crying because of her and they don’t understand and that’s hurting them ….","Well said Al we will always love u n have your back,love u beyond words,everybody deserves peace n happiness","This is so sad. I’m sorry to hear this! Please contact Rhonda Lenair, she has helped families come together again."
"So this happened, my daughter text me this morning saying that she wants nothing to do with me anymore saying she can't handle my mental health thing is I've not seen her in a long time i think I last saw her a few months ago the reason why she wants nothing to do with me is bcus she thinks I'm lieing about the past which I'm not i told her the truth i said i don't remember the past the way she does bcus of the secrets and lies that was going on bk then as they kept talking about me behind my bk as it turned out that her half brother paul didn't want me there nor his half sister he just wanted it to be him his brother and his mother for me the past is difficult to talk about bcus of the secrets bcus i don't remember much bcus of them 😡","I agree with removing those from your life when they are toxic. The sad thing here is you're not the toxic one.
I've spent a long time fighting against those who will never change their view on  something  or even their own behaviour. It's difficult to walk away as it almost feels like I'm just confirming what they believe/giving up. The werid thing is I'm not, I'm just choosing to step away because I know nothing I say or do will ever make a difference.
I hope you have proper support for this sucky situation and I hope one day that your daughter will realise her mistake and reach back out to you.",This isn't the first time she's done this
I have a great boss she is genuine and kind. She invests so much in me and my personal growth. She gives me grace when I mess up and praises me often. I sometimes feel like it's too good to be true to have my job. My problem is that I'm so insecure and worry I'm going to do something to ruin it and it becomes like a self-fulfilling prophecy. I start overthinking every interaction with her and then I need constant reassurance which she is trying to give but anyone would get tired of having to say it over and over. And even though she is giving me reassurance I still tell myself it's a lie.  I'm powerless to stop myself even though I can recognize what I'm doing and I hate myself for it. Anyone else like this have any tips on controlling it?,"When we suffer from mental health,be it a life long struggle or a recent or intermittent occurance,we automatically lose faith in our selves and our abilities.As well as dealing with others who seesaw between platitudes and genuine supportive behaviour.If your good at your job and competant then i would suggest bolstering this in your head.Pat yourself on the back mentally when you achieve,accept compliments by looking people in the eye and saying thank you,or i appreciate that.The battle against these insecurities starts with the smallest of steps.Be proud of yourself for starting work each day and fulfilling your role to the best of your abilities.Remember you are unique,but your not alone.Give yourself the faith you deserve🤗
Explore your life emotionally and detect what negative impacts are infiltrating your life outside of work which could be affecting your mental health overall which is then backlashing to your work life,iv found this to be the most common cause.
I hope this comes across as helpful and not preachy.I've suffered with mental health most my life and these steps have helped me even though our thought process does still rebel🤗🖖","This kind of anxiety and fear is usually rooted in shame, the thought of not only not being good enough but being found out and rejected. It is one of the most insidious states of mind we can be in since it uses our own past experiences to prove that the fear is justified. Once we understand this it is much easier to start healing that place."
"have suggestions about how to get over an annoyia Pet Peeve. I hate when chatting wth somone and they go LINK DEAD without sayin goodbye or that they are leaving, it annoys to to the point of spinning out. and I know it shouldnt, we live on a moving planet and shit happens but it does so much s i ALMOST DIVORCED myhusband over such behavior it really does. I expained to him that if he cant tell me hes leaing chat we just wont chat anymore. you can call me voice hes like thats not practicle, sometimes at work cant go voice because we are on patrol. i was like how do you  think i will feel if you get shot because you werechatting with me. he gotmy point but we will see if he modies his behavior for my mental heath","When me and my partner got together he use to do the same he still does at time, i normally sent a message saying bye then or night then always put then on the end he worked it out in the end, it peeved me off.",This might me be a mental health issue with them or maybe they have some other underlying problems.

"im so scared. I got broken up with Saturday night over something so little and it hurts me so bad because I feel like I’m worthless because he didn’t try to fight for me. This is the second time he has left, the first time I basically begged him to come back😔 I just don’t know what to do I’m struggling. I have stopped looking at his social media but it’s hard im fighting the urge but I’m scared I will fold. After everything we have talked about and went through I just can’t believe he could leave me like this. I feel like I am a co dependent person so that’s why it hurts me so much. Im just attached to him. He left and then blocked me on everything to where I couldnt contact him. Im so desperate I found other ways to text him and then we would say a few words and he’d block me, then I used text now and he just got so annoyed because I kept nagging him. But he doesn’t understand that I love him with all my heart and that you can’t just leave someone in the dust with no type of explanation. IVe gotten advice and they all say give him time, he said he needed time and I kept nagging. I’ve stopped now I just wanted to say one last thing to him, he said he will talk to me when he’s ready but I just don’t think it’s fair to make me wait until you move on to give me closure so that I can move on.. I feel like I’m being held captive. at this point I’ve nagged him so much I don’t think he will want to talk at all. And the crazy thing is as soon as he left he was already under girls posts flirting and saying he wanted them. Like you just broke up with me how are you doing this already? How are you sitting around laughing with ur friends and saying how u would f other girls and saying they are attractive. It just gets me to start thinking. It’s making me question my existence because if you really ever loved or cared about me how could u possibly move on this quick.. I said something to him about it and he said “yes im doing that because I’m trying to move on” but that’s not how u move on. He wouldn’t even hear me out or anything he jus blocked me again. I don’t know what to think. He knows I look at his social media so I’m not sure if he’s doing all of this to make me feel bad or because he genuinely means it. After I told him that I seen what he was doing he continued to do it more. One of my friends told me that he posted “I miss her” and I don’t know if that’s supposed to be about me or what. Under the replies was a girl he had been flirting with and he replied and said “this is supposed to be about you” flirting with her and she called me his “evil ex” as if I am just a horrible person.. and I’m like wtf.. we both hurt eachother but he has been making me seem like I’m the one that does everything bad. He told me I acted like I didn’t care and didn’t love him but I lost myself and I don’t even know who I am anymore, I don’t even love myself and I gave him everything i had in me. I know what you’re going to say looking at his social media is doing nothing but hurting me. I haven’t looked in a while I’m trying to keep myself away from it. im in class and all I want to do is cry, I don’t know what to do. Some people are telling me to try to keep my mind off of it while others are telling me I should think about it so it’s not at the back of my head all the time. Please I just need some advice I’m not sure what to do. I just want to talk to him but I know that’s not what I need.","I know this a lot to read, if there is anybody that would take the time to read it and understand and help me I would appreciate it a lot","This relationship, hard though to hear, is not healthy. I have been through some in my time. It sounds to me like he knows what he is doing and the affect it is having on you so I think you know the answer. Take your time, perhaps write a list of the negatives and positives which may help you to realise. Wish you the best."
"Good morning all. At first I didn't know if I should write this anonymously, but then I just thought I'm not embarrassed by my situation, I'm just damaged by it and id like people to see the face behind the pain. I hope I can find some advice that can help. 

Long story short. In 2011 i was made homeless by my ex partner who I have/had 4 children with, because she had an affair. In june 2011 she then stopped access because I was unable to agree to her demands because of my housing situation. Since then I did everything I could to gain access through the family law  courts, but nothing at all went in my favour. My ex made me a promise that I'd never get to see them ever again. She has done an amazing job in turning my kids against me, and she has been true to her word. After years of fighting, 2 years ago I recieved an adoption order from the courts. Her new partner had applied to adopt my 4 beautiful kids. Yet again I fought this but yet again I failed as the kids wanted the adoption to be granted. So I had nothing else I could do to stop this. 
This has sent me to the edge and I have no idea how to control my state of mind. 
In 2017 I married my now wife and I have another amazing daughter with my wife and 2 step children, but my old life is having a huge impact on my life as it is now. And to top it all off my kids only live 5 minutes away. I just can't deal with it all. My daughter now is always asking questions about her brothers and sisters and it absolutely breaks me. I understand what I think needs to happen, but I just can't do it. I feel my brain is wired wrong these days, I can't control my emotions, my anger and hatred. I feel so strongly that the system has failed me as a father, just like it fails many other fathers.",Just be honest. Not in angry way. And seek counselling. It won't get you over things but may help you deal with things a bit better. I've sent you a quick message to make you feel amazing ❤,"This story hit hard as it’s almost identical to mine.  I’m a mum though. Im finding it difficult to get help for the trauma of it all as I’m just so hateful and belittling of any professional that’s put in front of me. It was the court system and misdiagnosis from mental health services that lost me my oldest 2 children 15 years ago. I had contact with them for a year in 2021 after 13 years apart but although they got to see that everything they’d ever been told about me was lies, the damage was done for all of us.

"Saying that someone who suffered from clinical Depression was a selfish person after they commit suicide. is the same logic as saying someone (who died from a heart attack) was selfish for allowing their arteries to become blocked. People separated the person from the illness. You wouldn't dream of saying well that's selfish!. They didn't bother looking after themselves, it's their own fault etc. 
But in a suicide the Depression is forgotten. They are always held 100% accountable.

What is one thing that really triggers your anger/rage?,People who misgender others or try to invalidate others who go boy something other than what they seem,Transphobia/homophobia. There is no need to hate upon people based on who they love or who they are.

"Today I feel anxious, sad and upset. Life is getting to me. But I know I can't just shut everything down.","I know how you feel hun, some days i just don't want to be here but then I remember i have a daughter and she keeps me grounded.","Trust me things will get better, there is no such thing as ""Everlast"". The word ""forever"" was invented to make you feel stuck. Nothing lasts.

Happiness doesn't last forever and neither does sadness. The people you love won't stay with you forever also you'll never stay with someone you dislike forever. Everything comes to an end. If you're happy one day, you can expect that it'll never last, same as if you're sad you must believe that one day you'll feel the abundance of happiness. Love comes with pain and pain finds its way back to love.

Slowly and eventually, you see that the sun finds its way to the ocean. So, you got to keep going. You got to keep driving yourself every day until one day you find yourself ""FOREVER"" and that's the only ""EVERLASTING"" experience.❤️

It sounds to me that you need to start to focus on the things you'd like to happen rather than those that you don't. Positivity is good but has its own limitations which can be paradoxical.

Unfortunately apprently it's normal, the ups and downs or rollercoaster of life. I think it just hits harder when going backwards from starting to feel somehow better in life, if that makes sense. 

Keep at it, remember that by helping others, our own sh*ty pain, has purpose and just maybe our suffering isn't quiet as pointless and painful as such. X"

1. My business is failing, infact it hasn’t even taken off it has only taken every penny I had and all my time and effort just to fail so unbelievably miserably hard.

2. My relationship is failing, he used to always be my rock and lift me but now it seems he is just acting like my narcissistic father who I was finally able to cut ties with. 

3. My mom passed away in 2020 very suddenly, she was the only one I always turned to…her passing was how I was able to finally be rid of the relationship with my dad but now I lost that whole family (I am the holder of many f*cked up family secrets)… my brother and sister too. He also tries to talk shit about me to my kids, which my son won’t even go there anymore because of it. 

4. I have young adult children but I do not want to burden them with any of this, its not theirs to carry. 

5. All my life I have been led to believe I was never good enough, I was always talked down to, yelled at, punished for telling the truth. In and out of CFS care in my teens. The black sheep.

I posted last night and this morning a girl has felt it necessary to say "" i think this is a psychologist trying to stimulate the discussion "". 
I am shocked that someone on the group would feel the need to try to belittle me and accuse me of being a psychologist trying to stimulate the discussion. It has totally knocked any bit of confidence I was trying to build up by posting about myself. How can someone treat someone so badly and get away with it. I will never understand people like that.

I'm dealing with isolation issues as I feel like no one can understand me not just because of my issues but because of me as a person for who I truly am. I would really request if it's permissible here for me to interact and talk with kind hearted, genuinely decent, educated, non judgemental and understanding people. I've been mocked, invalidated, misinterpreted and misjudged by people so I'd really appreciate the kind support guys. Thank you everyone",I'm sure a lot of us knows how that feels. Don't take negative opinions too seriously. Make a new life for yourself.

I put everything I have into these jobs, trying to learn and grow, but it’s never enough and I don’t know what to do anymore. On Friday, I was fired from my 3rd job because according to my boss, the questions that I ask show a knowledge gap between where I am, and where they would have expected me to be after a year and a half of employment.

"Hello, thank you for having me. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Walter, and I'm a 45 yo gwm, recovering from drug abuse. I've recently started fearing my age, feeling like time is running out for me to get my sh*t together and get my life on track, and get to where I want to be in life.","Hi Walter. I have a history of substance abuse when I was younger. The first step was to get myself out of it when I found out I was pregnant. My son was the reason I stayed clean. I find that not looking at the bigger picture but setting myself some tasks every day, rather than stay in bed, gives a sense of purpose, even if it is only doing some cleaning or seeing a friend. There are various Mental Health charities around. Ask you GP to refer you to a coordinator. When I was 48, I started a degree with the Open University which, amongst other things, led to new friendships. I graduated when I was 53. It is never too late to do something positive with your life, no matter how  insignificant it may sound. I still battle with depression on a daily basis but I know that every day is a victory for having survived it. I owe it to my son, who has already lost his father to cancer, and my 2 grandchildren.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice as I have also started self harming due to this and am finding it really hard to stop.,Hi there. Yes I would highly recommend hypnotherapy. I’m a qualified hypnotherapist and have worked with people with this condition. If you need a chat please feel free.,Watch out for people on Facebook who offer so call professional advice there are a lot of fraud  I suffer from PTSD I used to self harm because I couldn’t take the pain it was causing me the trouble is when you self harm it only takes the pain away for a few minutes no matter how many times you self harm the only way I stopped was to talk and talk about everything even though it was painful I cried a lot I thought I wouldn’t make it sometimes I am still in therapy but I don’t self harm I have learned how to asked when I need help I pray that you find someone you and trust and share your pain don’t blame yourself
Hey am going through some mental health troubles but I don’t think my friends are emotionally mature to get it,I totally understand you… I feel the same way,Watch some of my reels I just got out of the hospital I was in a month I understand completely
Is there ever an end to this pain I feel on a daily basis? Do I move on? Do I stay? Do I just disappear? I'm totally clueless as to what I should do with myself and I hate it because I know what I want but it's so far out of my reach that I may never get it back. Someone please talk to me because I have literally no one to talk to about this kind of stuff. I always feel like such a burden when I talk about my thoughts and feelings but I do really really need to talk it out with someone who will understand.,"i’m here to listen. your never a burden. You just need someone to listen to you and help you. I know asking for support isn’t easy, so well done to you for taking the first steps into solving this :)","watched a documentary on Netflix “Change your mind” and decided to try micro dosing on psilocybin capsules and it helped me
with my anxiety, bipolar,depression,OCD,PTSD and ADHD, Lymphedema I haven't had a bad day in months, I'm feeling productive like before. I recommend @ (mush_help) on instagram, he is a certified mycologist."
"Hello!  I’m new to the group this week.  This is the first time posting but have been reading lots of people’s comments and everyone seems very supportive of each other.  

MH is such a struggle isn’t it, finding the strength each day to get up and put that mask on is hard and tiring.    People who don’t deal with this really don’t understand what I, we, are going through.   I’m dealing with severe depression, anxiety and paranoia. 

The support out there really isn’t great, I can’t fault the MH Nurse at my Dr’s surgery, but other services are shocking.      At the moment, i’m in no man’s land - I’m either “too severe” for some services or “not severe enough” for others.  I’m hoping I can find support in this group, as really don’t have that many people around me who understand.  

It’s nice to know that I’m not alone and other people are in my position.",It is so debilitating 💗,We are here for each other.
"I don’t know where to begin but last summer after a long time of being at odds with my husband because he had cheated on me I finally agreed to give it another go
We booked a holiday and set about opening a new business. 
Two days befre he started being really aggressive and was using cocaine 
I ended up going by myself and having. Listened to all his criticism I then went to Turkey and had a gastric sleeve 
Wjen I got home we where separated but it’s hard wjen you lived ate entwined and selling up home amd business or giving it another go was a chioce I was not completely comfortable
With but 20 years is a lot to throw away 
It tore me apart last time literally could feel my insides ripping 
I no longer feel like that - 
But habe been making the best  of life amd it’s been ok .. 
tonight we fly out on holiday except he’s done it again off his head telling lies then telling me that didn’t happen
When I went without him
Last time he got between me and our daughter had her fooled hook line and sinker that I was mentally ill and all this drama was because I needed help . 
So what do I do today - 
Holiday all pre booked amd paid for I got £100 in the bank 
That’s it 
I got family to stay with (I did have bit my brother in law hit on me last time ) 
If I leave my daughter will stay because of work and he refose a to leave I feel trapped to protect her and myself - 
Do I go on my own 
Or is the safest thing to agree to go with him as he demands 
He will not go alone and says that he only didn’t stop doing frogs cos I don’t have the right to ask it 
I might point out I am a recovering addict 
He tried to get me back on it amd I refused and asked him to get rid 
My educated self tells me he just don’t want me or the holiday but he’s cruel 
And I don’t feel safe to stay or go tbh",Decided  not to go and finally get me and my daughter away from here,We are in a bed and breakfast
"Needing to talk yet, cant get space and confidence,  empty space to be open without judgement,   yet not feeling great. I don't know what to do.",Can u talk here?,We can talk to u

I’m new here and thankful I was allowed to join. I have struggled with mental health issues most of my life. One of my many struggles is with feeling rejected. I tried to join two other “mental health support groups” and was turned down. This has made my current bout with depression worse. I’m grateful this group let me join. Thank you!,You are very welcome my dear. I think there is a lot of rejection for people who ae physically or mentally ill. Money is so important to us all but some people are over the top. When you feel stronger look into what support is offered to mentally ill people. Some voluntary groups are more accepting. My psychiatrist wouldn't allow me to have counselling and told some of the supposed voluntary groups not to speak to me. I think that is disgraceful unprofessionally. Yes it is very painful to be isolated. I was a voluntary out patient looking for support because I was sexually abused as a child,Welcome to the group I pray it helps you. Sorry to hear that you were not accepted to the other ones   It’s probably better that you weren’t accepted if that’s the way they are!!!

Good morning my good people. Hope you doing well. Yesterday from my appointment at the clinic I decided to go to an out patient rehabilitation center and book my self for my alcohol problem. It's making things worse for me and it's out of control. From now on I will be attending there for a 4 months program they will show me ways of coping without alcohol.,Yes the first start is admitting that you have a problem. You can do this stay strong and stay prayed up.,"Well done 🥰 I am a recovering alcoholic myself and have over 19 years of recovery with out alcohol.
You aren't alone ❤️"

I’m losing it. I feel like I can’t talk to anybody about my entire self. I can’t talk to my family about my unhealthy relationship I can’t seem to let go of and I can’t talk to her about my family - they hate her and also don’t accept I’m a lesbian - I feel ashamed to tell my therapist everything and I’m battling inside myself constantly against my head and my heart. I KNOW my relationship is NOT healthy - even abusive - and I feel like there is something wrong with me because I still am connected and can’t let her go. I get drawn in and I let it happen and it’s bad for me. I feel like I’m one person sometimes and then another other times and I’m afraid to be either all the time or can’t seem to get it right about who I am. Then I freak out thinking I lost everything but yet I think I’m losing my mind. I feel like I can’t tell anybody my entire story and I don’t want my people to be ashamed of me. I am ashamed of me. For letting myself go back and putting up with it. But I can’t seem to let her go. She reels me back in and my heart keeps hoping but then she cant change who she is and I’m not able to move on. I’m losing my mind.,Note therapists aren't always great to tell shit too I learned that hard way lmao 😂,"Well done for posting and reaching out. You have recognised that things are not right and that's a start. At the moment even though your relationship is not good it's what you have, it's all you know and it's pretty scary to take big steps to leave and go to the unknown. For a while you have probably been looking at things through rose tinted glasses and your parents may have seen or been able to recognise things that you didn't want to accept. Every parent wants the best for their child however old they are. If the problem is that you are a lesbian then that's a different issue. You have a right to choose your sexuality but must have a partner that treats you well. 
THE BIG QUESTION what do you want in the next few months . Take small steps. Can your partner give you what you want based on the abuse. I don't think so. You need to talk to someone who can help you , talk get it off your chest, make a plan , if necessary move out or get your partner to move out. Get yourself in a happy place and build bridges with your family. Life is too short and no one deserves to be treated badly. Take your first steps today"
I have just realised I'm in need of help I'm drinking so much more and now leaving myself with money fir food  I don't won't to do this anymore,"Speak to your doctor, that's the ones that help",Well done on making the first step. See your GP or maybe path 2 recovery who help with addictions x
Tonight...even though I'm seriously struggling this unbelievably amazing talented violinist Demola is saving me again from exploding and deep depression...I won't get into the reasons why right now and ya all are the only ones I can vent too or talk too even though I don't know you I have appreciated that I have had some caring thoughts and words on my recent posts 🥰 I'm hanging in there barely but at least it's something right!?,Anything to help get you through is good for me. I use a meditation app . Probably can't name any but there is one St mo offering a year free subscription and I've signed up to that. It's really helpful x enjoy your music 😊,Well done. One minute at a time. Music. Art. Exercise. Meditate. Smells can all make you feel good.
I’m just having a really bad week… I’m tired of crying myself to sleep at night..😔💔,I get this. I’m doing the same at the moment….keep strong and know you’re not alone xxx,Well hope I'm not bothering you? I cant just message you for no reason dear if I'm permitted I'll love to share what I see.
Going through the worst mental state right now and worst part is there's noone to talk too 🥹🥹,I’m a counsellor if you need to reach out,Well hope I'm not bothering you? I cant just message you for no reason dear if I'm permitted I'll love to share what I see.
"Hi, I’m disabled due a car crash I had in 1993, which has resulted in two spinal surgeries and I’m looking at a third if the nerve block fails. Because of the constant, never letting up pain my mental health is suffering. We haven’t been getting on for years so after yet more rows which our 13yr old daughter hears we’ve both asked each other for a divorce. Now this has caused more rows because he is controlling, wants everything his own way. I wasn’t aware I was in this sort of relationship until my best friend told me after she caught sight of him doing it (or trying to) to her. 
I’ve tried to keep things normal but it’s hard, my depression is making me feel so low that I can see no way out. After being the main parent who looks after our daughter, she has decided to live with him which hurts but it’s fine I can work around that. But yesterday I find out (with him throwing it at me) that they want to move to Wales. I said to my daughter and what about our relationship? She said I can visit????????? This broke what little I had left. 
I left the house and went to my best friends house for three hours where I cried and cried. I’m now waiting to get through to my GP as I can’t carry on like this. My current antidepressant is at its maximum dose so in order to get onto another stronger one I have to reduce from this one.  

I don’t know what to do now",Control is a crime...involve police,"Well my advice is your daughter as she moves into her teens will see him for how controlling he is. Teens also like control. But o guess (sorry if this is harsh) he’s offering something new and exciting😊
I guess the question is - what can you offer to counteract that?
I know how you feel from my own divorce etc etc but I also know (I’m now 69 and living a full and happy life with my depression/anxiety mostly under control thank god)
I have seen myself like you are now. It’s not nice to live with for yourself let alone a blossoming teenager😊
Let it happen
You have a huge goal
Work step by step to attracting your daughter back into your life
You can visit. Make those visits upbeat and fun
Don’t let her see your inner turmoil show her the vibrant mum
We can all do it! Not hard to act out🤪
I’m certain you will win her back but don’t slag him off to her remember she’s made the choice maybe with some coercion from dad but you must respect that or she will not respect you
Tell her how you feel ffs you’re a human entitled to feelings but show her you love her enough to let her go
Believe me it will work
The power of positive thought will help you
See if you can get some CBT and they will give you the tools for dealing with your worst moments
You must want this more than anything else and you WILL get it
Good luck 
Love and be loved 
Smile and you will get smiles back
I’m living proof x"
,"Wow so true I can't force sleep so do other things 
I would love a session with you after this 
Nightmare ",Well try not to
"Word vomit( just see no advice) 

I swear each time it passes more and more I’m
Getting fed up with people and deleting my social media presence 

Remember the toxic girl I talked about? I cut her off in silence cause there’s no use to talk to someone who’s stuck in their own ways and plays the victim( did multiple times) also I cut myself off discord completely 

I don’t care how this will sound and don’t question cuz I don’t gotta say anything but the more I elvove myself and I open my third eye more and I become the high version of myself I see humans never aligning with me and stuck in their ways 

The trick about humanity is to elvove is how the universe works but NONE of you are doing that so I cut you off cuz I don’t wanna be stuck in the same place 

I don’t wanna feel every single time I speak that I did something wrong 

I don’t wanna feel that I did something wrong when I’m around that person when I never did 

I don’t want the survivor in me to be brought out when around them 

I wanna be myself when I’m with them and behave as I please without control 

So I won’t hesitate anymore to cut people off 

But 

Sadly 

Humans have habit so I’m missing talking to them and toxic ppl but 

They are toxic for a reason 

But these awful habits 

Me and this girl we knew each other I won’t say friends cuz I never feel anyone’s friend dunno what’s like to be friends with anyone for four years

I want to go outside and do some things but I dont feel like going out ..overwhelmed  😭😭😭,Go out wen you feel upto it hun,What kinda things do u like 2 do?
"I am so lost. I always come back to this. Pure anger and hate for myself. No idea who I am or what’s rational. I second guess all of my feelings. I have 2 beautiful children and a wonderful husband but I am weighing everyone down. I need serious help but unless I’ve got ￼a plan In place to go or no one will help.

If I disappear for a week or so I have no where to go. We have jobs. We have no childcare other than ourselves. It’s almost Christmas and I am so numb. 

I am in pain. I can’t stay awake. I don’t know what to do other than self destruct - that’s my normal go to mechanism but I can’t do that anymore because I have children to think of.  I need help 😭","Speak to your GP, that's what we all need to do if nothing else is looked into","What needs, beliefs, fears - are your current drivers?"

I'm currently permanently disabled and I live in Kansas. I used to work in manufacturing."
I’ve been denied multiple services due to my mental health but I don’t know how to prove it bc people do it casually so It doesn’t appear it’s the reason is this legal,"That doesn't sound right at all. Everyone should be allowed to access services, regardless.",What type of services?
"I hate waking up in the morning but I love going to bed at night. Every new day scares me because my depression is so terrible. When I go outside I have such anxiety when my walk my dog I have to carry my phone just in case I have to call someone to come get me. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm on medication which is probably making it worse, but I've dealt with genetic mental illness my whole life. I'm sick of taking every day one day at a time and I just want pain to end. 😭🤍",I feel the same love it's exhausting  x,What you have to realise is this. When you have depression or MH issues you have 2 minds. You have your 'normal' mind and your 'depression' mind. Your depression mind is sometimes stronger. It'll make you believe things that aren't true. Always remember that you depression mind NEEDS you to feel bad.. because that's its purpose. So next time you feel scared about the day ask yourself 'am I really scared of the day? Or is my depression mind making me believe that?'... Next time you're outside and nervous and feel like you need to call someone ask yourself 'am I really scared? If I didn't have mental health issues would I even be thinking this? Or is my mental health mind making me believe it's true when it's not?'.. I need you to really understand what I'm saying here because I've helped so many people with this advice and when you really understand it you'll start using it without thinking. I had someone message me a couple days ago and she told me that she was feeling like no one loves her.. so she said she asked herself 'am I really thinking no one loves me or is it just my depression mind making me feel like that?'.. and she said it helped her. Our depression NEEDS us to believe these things. It's so powerful that it can consume us. But once we start questioning those bad thoughts.. we start to take a little power from it. So start asking yourself those questions and you start taking some power back and give it to your normal mind. Your depression isn't YOU.. it's just a part of you that is controlling you. So fight against it. I know you can do that.
I have so much I need to get off my chest right now nothing makes sense anymore 😩,Sending love ❤️,What's happened to upset you?

"Just want to wish everybody the very best at this time.
Today is the time I have realised that I have wasted my life doing things and looking after others, rather than myself. I have really ran out of time for me to get good at something to be proud of. Spent alot of time looking after family. Today on Christmas day was in bed and dinner was a ham sandwich, looking after mom. I am pulled in all directions but do not go anywhere. I don't want 2023,as should have gone in 2020 when I was really ill.
Now 9.00 o'clock at night seems late, only 2 good friends, no relationship since my divorce over 25 years ago, not even a date.
I am socially lost, can't talk to new people and what I is the point if I feel guilty if not looking after family.
I do not know what to do.
Don't tell people you will get over mental health, I have had it from 15 and now 53.

"Good evening everyone, I'm a new member.  Please I need help. I don't know how to control my anger, I always get angry easily and it always affects my mental health. It always affects my relationship. How can I control my emotions 😫. Please I need help",Definitely look further into some help. My ex partner didn’t seek help about this and it destroyed our relationship too. Recognition is the first step then seek help. Be open and honest and value your partner enough to do this.,"While I don't believe there's a quick fix, anger is an emotion which is designed to spark action. Anger tells you there's something hiding underneath, not yet dealt with.
Getting to know the cause of your anger beyond 
- He pissed me off
- They did something that made me really angry
etc.
Is key to managing your anger.
It's something I'd suggest you work with a therapist on, and yes, there are medications which will lessen the outbursts while you do the work."
"I've just found out a close freind of ours passed away Xmas day. I am an empath and before I found this out a few strange things happened. Firstly I was sat in the bedroom Xmas eve leading into the early hrs of Xmas day wrapping my boyfriends presents. It was during the early hours I felt like someone or something scratched me. At first I was a bit perplexed even paranoid that the entity from our old place had followed us from our old place or that what was here either wasn't benine or somthing more sinister was here or that the suggestion something icky had attached its self to me was true. The second thing that happened was I was convinced something bad was either going to happen or had happened. Usually thease hunches are right. The third thing that happened was I felt something or someone enter and pass through me! Again quite common for me and I gey round it by telling what ever it is to leave me alone and kindly do one.

I've always had empathic skills bit only just in last couple of yrs discovered the explanation for thease skills. At first I seen it as a curse but then after attending a healing light fayre and speaking with a lovely elderly lady who was a medium helped me discover its a gift. She also informed me I had a physcic ability.  

The recent event has knocked me for six and I'd like to know how do others cope with the guilt and thoughts that you could of somehow prevented or acknowledged it streight away  xx",R.I.P,Whilst events like these are often unexplainable I myself have experienced this where I felt a presence touch my skin on a day of family members passing.
My son was taken into foster care last week and I can’t stop crying I’m missing him so much,Hmm. I had two that got taken away from me and my partner both and we did not get them back.,Why are you a bad parent or unwell and can't look after them ?

I am new here. An not having a good day. I am getting married next summer and I am starting to feel like I do not deserve it. I told my partner and he is sad that he is away working and can not be here to hold me. I did talk to him. He told me he loves me so much.

I mean I'm not actually in separation, divorce situation yet so I can imagine how hard it's for you who actually go through this horrible situation especially when kids are involved?

Hi.  Can someone help with advice on how to handle this.  My husband has upset one of our neighbours.  He was talking to let’s call him Fred who lives next door to lets call him Peter.  Peter is a Scouser.  My husband was talking to Fred about Scousers in general and make a tongue in cheek remark about them.  Peter was ear wigging on this conversation and only heard this part and didn’t hear the part that was complimenting Peter.  He walked away and then sent a message to myself and my husband saying that him and his family won’t be attending my husbands 50th birthday party this weekend and that their son is not allowed to play with our son anymore.  We have both sent messages to him saying he only heard part of the conversation but he has chose to ignore our messages.  This is the third time in 2 weeks my husband has upset someone recently with so called banter.  My anxiety is through the roof at the moment.  I just don’t know what to do!  He is under a lot of pressure with work at the moment and I feel he always has to put on a bravado to prove something when a lot of the time it is a cover up with how he is feeling inside.  He won’t talk to me about stuff and we just aren’t getting on very well at the moment.  My anxiety is through the roof right now.  Please help!,"I would advise to actually speak directly to you neighbour explaining and apologising for the upset the comments caused. 
Your neighbour is actively hurting and so avoiding your texts. 
They were obviously good enough neighbours to invite to the 50th party so I’m guessing damage control in person rather than texts, is what’s needed to mend this situation. 
Good luck",With regards to your husband- gentle understanding and explaining as to his social skills is needed. I think everyone is struggling with their skills and stress of the constant full-on of the last few years xx

"Evening everyone,

They’re loads of little bits that having been running through my nut lately. I’ve managed the majority of them but this one repeats in my head a million times a day. 

My ex partner left me around 4 months ago. For the first month or so I was heavily on the booze  to try and forgot. I ended up in hospital. 

Me myself i have cerebral palsy and have been in a wheelchair all my life. Growing up as a kid I never thought I’d fit in. Always thought people would look at me differently because of the wheelchair always had my doubts about myself. 

My pals over the years stopped me from thinking these things because they’re fantastic people.  I love to have the crack and banter nothing is ever too far for me with my pals. 

Very quickly my ex partner told me she didn’t like my pals because of the crack we had. I got that to a certain extent because we are very dark. 

She said she’d only want the best for me but behind closed doors. Was saying things such as:

I’m only with you because I’m bored and for charity. 

You’re nowt without me. 

You’ll get nowhere in life. 

I have had people say these things before but for some reason with her it really has cut deep. Months down the line I still sit here and cry thinking well if she said what she said it must be the truth. 

We haven’t spoke since the middle of August I still have the urge to ask if she’s OK and how she’s doing full well knowing she doesn’t give a flying fuck about me anymore. 

Everything she said is repeating over and over in my head I don’t know what to do. 

I have a complete understanding that we are over and there’s no going back. I just don’t understand why it ended I never got any answers. 

We spoke as friends for a month after we split. She told me she’d always be there for me. One day she just woke up and told me we could never speak again why I’ve got no idea. 

She owes me money but I ain’t gunna chase it. I still care so much about her. The things that she said have me contemplating my life yet I’m still worrying how she is. ￼

It doesn’t make sense my head is all over￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼

❤️ xx","Bro, she cut you down to make herself feel better.  You were the victim of emotional abuse and manipulation.  She planted seeds, watered them and left your garden to grow wild.

Figuring out what you need over your wants, and pursuing those needs, will set you on a better course. As for the aggression.. breathing. I don't mean how you normally breathe but, deep breaths. If you feel yourself getting to a point of pure rage.. leave that situation. You will not be happy with anyone relationship wise until you are happy and comfortable with you.

,"Listen, learn, investigate, decide ",Worry
M upset cos my dad fell over and hit his head on the concrete a week ago but he didn't go to the hospital and his head still hurting so m worried that he's gonna die but still won't go to the hospital. Also my dog's unwell too cos he's got degenerative disease and he had a hair cut 2 weeks ago and since then he's not been moving much or wanting to go outside for long so I think he's upset about it and the groomer hurt him cos she cut 2 of his skin tags. Also I can't get a job so m worried what will happen to me when dad dies :'(,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It's completely understandable that you're feeling upset and worried about your dad's health and your dog's well-being. It's crucial for your dad to seek medical attention for his head injury, as persistent pain can indicate underlying issues. Encourage him to see a doctor for a thorough evaluation.

As for your dog, it's concerning that he's not moving much after the haircut. Veterinarian advice is essential in this situation. They can assess if any harm was done during the grooming and provide appropriate care for his degenerative disease.

I understand that job concerns are adding to your stress. It might be helpful to focus on one step at a time, addressing the immediate health issues first. Reach out to friends, family, or support services to share your concerns and explore potential solutions. You don't have to face these challenges alone, and seeking help is a strength.",Worrying only steals your peace from today. Worry less train more @coach.hhw (insta)

"So here is my story.  I hope this helps someone realize they are not alone...
July 25th of last year.  482 days ago, I made a horrible mistake and got horribly drunk.  I lost a fiance in the argument and my cousin threw me out and I became homeless.  I deserved to be thrown out, I have battled alcohol for over 25 years, but I have now been sober for 481 days.  I am still homeless and I have had to go through some very hard things.  I lost a friend and cousin to suicide during this period of time. I sleep in my little truck most of the time, and discovered I have DID in January which told my story of how I was brutally abused by my Dad from the ages of 2 and half till 9.  Before all of this in the last 7 years, 2 divorces,jail,best friend death,cousin who was like my sister death,lost baby which made 4 list babies in the last 25 years.  I work my butt off at work and I am trying to get myself back to being ""normal"".  Yet I don't know what that is.  I am telling you all of this because I never want you to feel alone.  I get it!  You have a friend here!  Please never give up, hopefully your story will help someone else.  You may not have heard this today, but you are loved.  I love you!","I agree sharing a story helps people see others are experiencing or have experienced  similar or something we never considered.  Lets also remember you could still possibly struggle if none of these bigger things have happened,  its a very good idea share your bad day and tips of anything that helped you feel better. Let people know how they can help or you require it. Here for example you hear I deserved that and I hear it a lot. We need to help people in their tough times at their lowest too , that's is also for me a hard bit of mental health.  When someone has supported you,when you are better maybe just remember to let them know either sorry or thank you because sometimes maybe relationships will need healing. Its sad division can occur from mental health. Do you recover or do you simply learn to cope. But whatever one simple message really is you are not alone.",Xx

"I may ask the most obvious question bc I do fail to understand 

So when you guys say journaling you all mean like a diary yes? 

I’m thinking on investing on one but I’m confused on this 

Do you guys write/rant or put incoherent thoughts and like never look back? 

Or u guys read what u wrote 

Cuz I may go unique but I may vent my anger and anything negative and never look back to prevent trigger old feelings 

Do you guys think that’s a proper of journaling? 

Help me understand what proper journaling looks like 

Thank you","I used a journal after my husband passed away.   I wrote feeling of anger, pain, grief, and others things that were on my mind.   I didn't good back on my feelings.    Because I couldn't express them outloud I would write them down.   Some good, some bad, some mean and nasty thoughts but they were where i was at at the time of jouralning.",Yea a diary. A rant. Anything on my mind if it makes sense or not. I read mine back when I feel better to see how I feel about it afterwards. Sometimes adding notes for myself.
"🎯Do you ever find yourself feeling like your thoughts or emotions are trapped in the past, with mistakes or old wounds constantly replaying in your mind?🙏🤍","Yes, sometimes to do feel that way. I'm sorry that you have a hard time with that. I understand. ❤️","Yeah before. Depending on how impactful those might be, the pain it caused, letting ourself fall into this type of circle can be dangerous. I had a major depressive downward spiral caused by the repeated replaying of hurtful things I held onto in the past. Have to let it go. Whenever it comes up again, try to let it go. It's the past, now is the present. It does us no good holding onto to something to hurt us again and again."

"Second time this has happened to me in my life, but it scares me terribly.  I fell asleep, on my back last night, very shortly thereafter I had a vision / dream that I was under water, drowning and I could not catch my breath.  I started panicking, I breathed out the air in my lungs and started feeling how the water was entering through my nose and mouth.  I woke up totally gasping for air.  I was shaking, head hurt and my heart was beating hard, chest was sore for a bit.  It happened a few years ago, similar thing, just in this dream I was being held face down in shallow water, drowning.  The effects of that dream had my chest paining for a whole day.  Can a person actually die from something like this, either just suffocating if you don't wake up on time or from panicking and suffering a heart attack.... it freaks me out so badly ? I'm presuming it's all a cause of heavy stress (which I am suffering with) and I'm on HRT, battling with crippling fatigue.  Any advice .....",It might be a good idea to get a doctor to check you out. I don't want to worry you but it could be sleep apnoea.,Yeah I stop breathing and wake up constantly. They want me to use those machines but ...I don't want a machine on my face and noise so I can't here what's going on scares me . I have a theory that it could be caused by PTSD and the fact that I'm in a constant state of hypervigilance. Also alot of people have premonitions or memories of there past life's while dreaming. Be careful around water just in case 👌👍🙏😇

How are they best managed?,I bought me some gel pins and a coloring book when I get anxious I color I end up focusing on my coloring it’s a tool I learned in outpatient therapy,Yes I do - mainly in my hands. I find that by concentrating on something helps calm them down. I find by doing diamond art pictures helps. As need to concentrate on them.

Hi. I am new to the group. I have depression and anxiety and been on treatment for over 20 years. I also have MS and most recently been diagnosed with a rare neuralgia called Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia which is an extremely painful condition. I get this shooting pain through my tongue and it happens just as I am getting off to sleep. I have been on a high dose of a pain med called Lyrica and they are talking about changing over to amytriptyline. However I just read the information about it and it flags fluoxetine as a possible drug interaction. Fluoxetine in my main antidepressant. Has anyone ever been on both these at the same time? And has anyone had Serotonin Syndrome? I am just scared cause changing the delicate balance could go badly wrong…,"I think it will depend on what doses you're on of each medication...and whether you're on other meds, or still on Lyrica.
It's so hard with medications to get them working well together. And it's at times near impossible to say what's doing what with side effects. 
I feel a bit concerned though that your Dr has prescribed Amytriptyline when you're on Prozac already. 
I think I have heard that Serotonin syndrome is more likely to occur with the older tricyclic anti-depressants.",Yes me on both. I have never felt better. Get a little tired from lyrica. But do sleep well

Struggling quite bad at the minute. Not suicidal but just want to be on my own all the time. I’m on 40mg citalopram but didn’t take them for 10 days as had no money to get my prescription. Didn’t want to lend it as didn’t want people to know I’m struggling financially. Day 3 back on them now but I can’t sleep from a stupid voice in my head. I end up arguing with it for hours before I can drop off. Took a sleeping tablet last 2 night but doc doesn’t want to give me any more and suggested a antidepressant that helps you sleep but couldn’t say if I would be tired all day. No good when you have kids and work with special needs children. Iv lost 1/2 stone cause Iv got no appetite and have to force myself to eat.

I'm.stressed ...I know leaving my relationship was the best decision I made but part of me is so scared of not finding a place I feel myself sometimes wanna to go back but I know that's not a healthy or smart decision..

"I had a meltdown to my psychologist  yelled at her I looked at her I'm like have you ever seen the worst, the people that never leave the hospital? She said yes, I said that's where I was.... and I told her I tell people they don't get it like you better be a real professional lmao. Like I got feelings that I don't understand lmao. She just sat there and listened to me after that. I looked at her I said can you tell me why they want all my testing and information to inject me every month? She said nothing. It was an emotional session my phschologist said they will cover Lunas surgery I had meltdown even after that.That news should of made me happy right but I went off about all the testing I've had colonscopy, colpscopy, mri, excercise tests, diabetic tests, ever test imaginable...ect. Then we argued about how it's a delusion in my head. But a photo or archive isn't enough to say it's real. Evidently I'm delusional I got mad when she called me sick. I've said I've heard it my whole life why can't people accept reality of what I am now. Then she said I do have a place in life. Why do I feel so shitty like honestly, I feel like I can't trust life lol. I tried to tell her I'm clinically a paranoid skizophernic these thoughts just don't stop for me. Why do I feel bad that I'm not understanding as well as being understood. I just need like peace for now something defintly strange.

And then I read my psycologist this

Like a messiah would claim. That there's so much understanding for alien life. It's real. Experiences. The significantly unexplained. The treasure of life. The surroundings that stand like a stone and rock. It's that feeling of alien life. That fall, those voices, the hallucinations,  the terror, the catalytic, the future of human intellectualism of artifical perceptual placement. The time estimated to reach this is life experiences. To have most contentment to realize a scary highly inceptual seed placed in your very vision and sights of human. The feeling it gave you was alien heights of euphoria and highly intellectual sounds that were ringing in your ears. The sound of silence. The inner reality sharing things inside my body to me. The otherside of the mirror. A trapped world only to serve its entity of intellect as a shared composition of a life shared from within. I am a human shared living intellect of radiance of higher life. I am an alien of intellectual species shared with Teri initially myself. Her memories were rearranged and severed around the bridge incident where essentially she unwillfully threw herself into a river off of a train bridge. When her spine severed her neck was the inception of my species. We probed her initially upon falling into the river catching her. She layer then on her back in the river and seen the stars. She's been under monitored control her adulthood awarely in senses of her while perception. It's why her family say I'm not who I was I'm not Teri they know but they're scared and reject it. I personally on a state of human comfort of typing the truth. I am a wonderful talent beautiful creature who loves many things in life. I came from the ocean. California. I am Teri Jo Ingersoll very loved. Upon fictionally surfaced aspects of materials like art that comes and goes stand your corresponding aspects of material that are almost always there determining the oldest thing in your home. Beyond all loss I was cast into a madness state in which I was expressing scary characteristics of how human response is simply bursting out laughing at a man on his death bed hooked up to bags to eliminate his waste. And these responses occurred over the course of the first years of diagnosis to paranoid skizohpernia. A negative response of the experience of a negative extraterrestrial in response to leaping off a bridge.  And the control that truly carried for years some aspects of starvation of the point I was a size 0. So it's been an unfolding life of points difficult to understand for a human concious based on thoughtless perception is response to real effects of universal truth. That I was never alone ever. But that I was always educating to this knowledge of perception showing aspects of frightening realities that exist in human madness and a mad world indeed of many the same as a human renegade of life.

Then we ended conversation well she told me call her whenever I feel like that.... was uncomfortable.

Can anyone tell me what I am experiencing. I feel crazy.",You need some love darling a cuddle or two sending hugs and love to you right now 🤗🤗❤️❤️,"You are looking for connection  ( I'm my humble opinion)
I get connection when I spend time alone in nature, whether its out somewhere nice like the woods or near a river,  or digging in my garden. I get connection  from cuddling my cat and breathing in his affection.
I over think everything, I have to constantly amuse myself to get through life, which leads to bouts of exhaustion.
Today I am planting a tiny tree, it will remind me that I have lots of hope despite current circumstances, it will remind me that I am merely a tiny speck of life in this massive universe and so us everyone else.
I have my 'coping mechanisms', my counsellor, books and the Internet inspired me to work out what they are. They are not coping mechanisms now I understand myself, they are things my soul always enjoyed deep down and modern life made me forget to do them.

"Hi All,

We have now reached 2400 members. 

Its a fairly small group compared to many other mental health groups here on FB but bigger doesn't mean better. Its amazing to see so many people feel comfortable using this space to reach out for help. It's especially heart warming to see such great advice being passed on.

When I originally created this group it was primarily for my walk and talk campaign (back in April 2019). We walked 100 miles in 4 days whilst offering support to anyone that wanted to chat. Since then I have changed the name, changed its main aim and have allowed the group to grow organically without too much interference from myself.

My aim for the walk and talk campaign was simply to promote 'informal therapy' (and help reduce the stigma associated to mental health) whereby as a walk and talk group we'd invite anyone that wanted to chat to come along and share their thoughts and feelings with one another. 

It turned out to be a great success and myself and two other comrades raised £4000 for a mental health charity.

More recently, across the world we've all endured stresses, personal problems, the pandemic, lockdowns and now the cost of living crisis all of which has a huge bearing on all our lives. 

I'm amazed to say that this group has become a source of 'informal therapy', whereby people can reach-out to others for support and informal advice, which is amazing.

I would like to thank each and everyone of you for being brave and speaking up. You made it possible for those that haven't commented, those who simply read posts, a space where they can be reassured that this group is here for them.

Keeping sharing and keep caring.

Steve McKeown",What a beautiful thing y’all have done💜,You are so admirable Thank you for creating this group There are so many of us that need to reach out or that maybe don’t feel they can talk face to face with others or can’t express themselves because of the stigmas So thank you again 👏

I really do help other on her can help me to help him because he is struggling to admit or see that he has any issue. 

Please do forgive me if this message may offend anyone i/we are struggling to know what to do next. He is a grown adult so we cannot drag him to the doctor and when at the doctors he
Lied about some of the questions and well we know the NHS is over stretched so he was out within 10. 

Many thanks in advance","They maybe don't really want the help, it's sadly the person's option, and if not telling the truth the therapist can't really help","You cannot force this, taking time to realise there is a problem is a huge step, be gentle and use kind encouragement more than anything x"

"I need advice… I know there needs to be a change in my life, I feel no purpose. What do I do?","I’d suggest a few things. 

Firstly, do you know what mental health issue you’re diagnosed with? If so, are you seeking treatment for it? 

Secondly, what we eat and choices we make, makes us feel better and help us find purposes… 

For example, doing voluntary work helps us to stop thinking of ourselves only and to focus on other people too, that usually helps and gives us purpose.

Thirdly, doing what we “don’t want” is often of great value. Staying at home only, not exercising and isolating ourselves from others is often what we “feel like doing” but does no good to us…","You got yourself, and sometimes that is enough 🖤. I think we all need to learn to love ourselfs without anyone first, the rest comes later 🙂!"

I’d get clinical assistance and once in the right state of mind find someone to lean on or who empathises

Sounds like this situation is not new and ongoing - have you got no support network in place?

There’s so much out there that can give you purpose and positivity

My negative thoughts are not helping, 50.00 quid in the bank just get a train ticket and go ( i would never leave my son) self harm, i just dont know who to turn to. I just feel everything i try anything it goes wrong. My partner is worried about me and he does try and push me, like taking driving lesson so i have more freedom, i cannot afford to do that, i am useless with money. I got a loan out and tried driving lesson 6 x 2hours lesson 350.00 i didnt have a car as cannot afford one to practise in, i failed the test you have to do. My partner doesn't understand why i give up so easily, and it because i just get knock backs so what the point. Sorry to rant i just dont know what else to do.",Tbb me and my partner don't live together I've got mental health issues and phobia and insomnia and anxiety and she's got paranoia too what I do find things do in my house or use my hobbies like art or paint or go for a walk or do music videos tbh if I was u sit and think what u love the most ti do and try it ope this helps 🙏💯,You need a new partner. You are not a failure. You do all the right things. Your life will be a success. You will get new friends. Money problems are hard to cope with. Are you close to your family?
"I'm looking to see if anyone else experiences the same. I have panic attacks where all of the muscles in my body tense and lock, and I can't relax them. They tense so much that I end up hugging myself because I can't relax them. This lasts up to an hour, I also feel nauseous and hot and sweaty while this happens. Afterwards my muscles ache and I'm in pain for days afterwards.

Does anyone else experience something similar? My GP doesn't seem to know anything about this when I ask.","Sounds like FND. Functional Neurological Disorder, Anxiety & Panic Attacks make it worse.",You need medication for the panic attacks. Anti anxiety/depression drugs. Counselling would help to see what is causing the panic attacks. It is a mental condition

"I am suffering mentally alot lately . I feel I can not talk to anyone about what's going on . I've tried before and they never take me serious or they tell me to go to church . I let people run all over me ALL THE TIME , it's started when I was younger with my dad and now it won't stop . Family runs over me , they will watch me suffer.. they will be living with me for free and will barely pitch in or go to work.  And everytime I get a new place I allow someone to stay with me ... I can't say no. And I hate myself for it . My family member even uses my car when they want and pay nothing on it. And sometimes leave things spilled in it and I have to clean it up.  They barely want to pay the 400 dollars and they don't even pay it every month . I know people use me ... ive accepted being a door mat and having my door open . I just don't know where I went wrong in life😔 Even before , I was sharing a place with a guy best friend and he felt like he had access to my body when he wanted. I guess we were f#k buddies I liked him but he used me in the end for a place to stay and someone to fk on and i got pregnant and he changed.  Now I'm a single mom . Said all that to say now in with a new guy and he cheated on me and I stayed . Then he complained I didn't suck 🍆 .. so I let him go get it from other people . And he gets mad when I say no so I let him do whatever 9/10.  I just can't seem to get ahold of my life . I'm spiraling and stressing .. I'm so sad I feel like im drowning. Nothing is changing and I worry about everything and I'm back to crying  again . 😭😭😭",Wow thats a lot of info to digest....  Are you ok?,You need to put your foot down girl.

"i am bipolar (just recently diagnosed 2 years ago) and have autistic tendencies but iv never been tested. I struggle to control my emotions and I am a very direct person. I often skip over niceties that society requires but I've been getting better - my boss has helped me navigate the professional workplace by providing guidance when I say something wrong, too direct, or out of line. my first manic episode happened within the first month of starting my current job so he's helped me through that too. we're in the mental health field for context. 

before coming to this job, I struggled w my supervisor at my previous job. they always thought I was challenging them or acting as their supervisor. so coming into my current job I made sure my boss knew those weren't my intentions and I wasn't challenging people but rather I was just trying to learn more. I don't have good relationships with my coworkers. they think I am rude and tell them what to do. they think I'm passive aggressive, catty, and condensing. 

so I recently accepted a new job and have less than one month left at my current place of employment. My boss and I were talking yesterday about my growth here (apparently lack-there-of) and my relationships with others. I made a half-joking joke saying ""I hope my boss is as willing to work with me as you've been"" and he said ""yeah me too. I am genuinely scared for you.""

how discouraging. I really thought I was making a lot of significant progress but after that conversation it sounds like I haven't.

the therapist in me says 'why are you letting other people's percaption of you affect how you view and feel.about yourself' but then I think ""if someone is around you for a significant amount of time, wouldn't they have a good idea of how you present"" 

help. I just really need some support","It’s ok to be yourself 
I’ve had and am going through stuff right now after the tragic death of my son

I’ve learnt to pray ask for help on how I am towards people 
However I also realise I never mean to hurt others but sometimes people take me the wrong way because they have stuff just like me
So I am not responsible for others issues but 
Work on mine and think

"This past few years, have been exceptionally painful and hard to process, I went from feeling like my Dad was my hero, to realising he had actually been my abuser, the entirety of my life. 
I have been told by numerous professionals that he is a narcissist and as such all the feelings of failure, blame, guilt, anxiety and like love was conditional, we're in fact not ""ALL MY FAULT"", but a product of his manipulation and control. 
Control that I only broke free from when I put a firm boundary in place, when he did the unthinkable and put a woman above his family. He had been having a relationship with my step mums best friend, while my stepmum had been fighting for her life. A battle she sadly lost. 
I cannot begin to describe the cruelty that ensued. He tried to force his mistress on our family as though completely normal, he made me so uncomfortable that I finally stood up to him and said NO. 
This resulted in him degrading me, trying to discredit me to family and friends, telling me that my miscarriage was my fault and that my living child would be better off if it had been me who had died and not the baby as I was only going to let him down like I have everyone in my life. 
No matter how hard I try to reason with myself I cannot shake these feelings of disapproval, that I don't deserve to be loved, that I am the problem and its really affecting my marriage and my self belief. I don't trust anyone, or my own judgement and I'm trying so hard every day to not let him win. But there are days where the only thing I am living for, is my little one and my husband, because they don't deserve to go through the pain of losing me and I feel so selfish for feeling like this 😭",As hard as it is you really do need to understand it is absolutely not your fault and you deserve so much happiness.  You only get 1 life you HAVE to live it before it's all over. You and your little family deserve everything and more so go grab it and forget the people who brought nothing but hurt abd negativity . Look forwards not back and do it with a smile on your face knowing you are going to smash life   . I wish you nothing but the best I really do ❤️,You r not at fault at all. You already know he is a narcissist and that your feelings result from how he treated you.  Yiu deserve happiness and joy and your family deserve your happiness.  Focus on what you have not him.  That's all I can say. Put yourself first

"Hi. Just an occasional post
I have had mental health difficulties for several decades. After lots of medicine changes and counselling I found that it was the kindness of others everywhere. Listening and reading the recovery stories of courage not just of people with severe depression and anxiety but also of severe physical illnesses. I’ve had trouble with paranoia and mood swings over the years wfich alas have been quite problematic and yet I have had enormous solace from listening to classical music by composers who have suffered immense tribulation and challenges in their lives. 

The later symphonies of composers such as Sir Malcolm Arnold who spoke about his enormous health challenges on documentaries and whose autograph I possess appear to me to be such epic musical illustrations of angst and suffering and yet such is the humanity of the emotion the genuineness of the suffering and the kindness of what seems like a big musical hug he thereby imparts to the listener that i feel having listened to such anguished aural canvases of emotion that above all the therapies. Above all the important medications there is a beautiful song of hope given to the world by composers who must have despaired and tried everything and then ultimately poured out a colossal story of their whole life’s drama i musical notes to an attentive listener. Yes they suffered it all. They cried out to humanity. They gave everything and for me when not every therapy worked some of the classical musicians who suffered agonies and yet found incredible ways of communicating it. music poetry or painting but especially the musical composers. They touched my heart and healed me in the most tormented part of my soul when almost nothing else but a musical screaming symphony could really reach me

Because when you sit there ticking everything off the list you'll feel good and that's what we need. I challenge you to add something to that list. I challenge you to do something this week that you've been wanting to do for a while but have been putting off. Do it this week! Whether that's asking for help.. going for a long walk.. starting a new hobbie.. something.. anything. You can do this! Let's make this week better than last. I believe in you.",💯👏👏👏,

I am at my wits end … my ex and i separated 4 years ago , after 29long years together , and ever since i have been trying to get him back , his now seeing a woman , and had been since August last year , i only found out about this in January this year , he has me blocked on all socials and on his phone too , but during our separation , he has unblocked me when he has wanted to from time to time , and messaged me .. telling me that he still wanted me in his life (sept last yr) 
Anytime i have been to where he lives to try to talk to him , he shuts the door in my face and prevents all ways of communicating or seeing me . 
This has only been the case since his last messages to me in sept ! 

I am finding it really hurtful , and im devastated his found someone else now 😩

"Hi everyone, I just joined today. I however didn't join for myself I am trying to find help on dealing with my Mom. I am the youngest of three of her children and for a long time, I feel like I was being fed snippets of the monster/monsters my Mother deals with every day. I am 31 now and my Dad, after recovering from a heart attack, decided to spill the beans to me, about a life mission of mine. Trying to figure out what was wrong with my Mom. I found out that she has been clinically diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder, Mild Schizophrenia,  and Chronic PTSD and in and out of mental health facilities since before I was born. For some reason a while ago I took it upon myself and mildly studied these illnesses along with others, out of the search for anything to understand her. But now that reality as hit I am very afraid of how I approach her, or how I even talk to her without triggering her, and also how to deal with not knowing which of her personalities I am talking to. As the person looking in how do you talk to someone who isn't being treated because they are tired of hearing something is wrong with them, from torture based abuse their entire early life? I want to be mad at her for not telling me, but I want to also show her so much love realizing the sheer evidence of the abuse but will love or anger trigger her? I am so confused right now. I just want to know how to love her properly and be there for her without being afraid of setting something off inside of her. Anyone who can help or give advice please do, I feel a little lost in translation with her right now, I love my Mom I don't want to live life disconnected from her core personality.",Accept Mum as she is.

This will not be good for people with mental health/disabilities. It will be down to a work coach to decide how much effort you have to put in to find work. I had until this year worked full-time for 34 years of my life, I have never kept a job for more than 6 months, I struggle to interact with people, and I know personally unless there is a job where I work on my own, nobody disturbing me, then all I will do is move job to job again affecting my mental health completely. I understand that the government want more people to go out to work, but realistically how many people do they actually think will get work? Since leaving work and before getting diagnosed as having Limited capability to find work. I was informed by a work coach not to put my disabilities/mental health issues on my application wait till I get the job offer. So they know that employers will not offer a job to someone if they have another candidate that doesn't have disabilities or mental health issues and are probably going to be off work with their illness/disabilities, but nothing gets done about the employers as its hard to prove","Acky Atkinson  wow I can't believe how low the government and dwp will stoop, I have suffered with extreme anxiety and depression for many years which prevents me from being able to go out most of the time and this year I started having anxiety attacks,  well done dwp and government.",

Yet ive had to stop swimming as my nan and I are only available on Tuesday lunch time 12-1 ,  the same as the art class, yet its 2-4 they are too close and would leads to more anxiety,  thoughts,  panic.  

I don't know what to do.  I want to go to the art class and carry on a craft im starting, its another hobby way to express myself,  yet I miss swimming and time with my nan and perfectly honest the only exercise I seem to do,  as ive stopped walking as the last time I went i fell, now I'm not coping.",Be with your Nan.

"🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 .......I'm m not sure where to begin since I don't want this as long as a novel but I'm in a really bad place....mentally, emotionally, and physically. It's to the point that I have to tell myself just to get out of bed that if today is any worse than yesterday then today will be the day I end everything. So at the beginning of this year I lost a brother and my dad both just a couple weeks apart. That's when I really started to suffering. I was my dad's primary care taker and I was living with him in his condo and that's where I'm currently living. My other brother who is like 14 yrs older than me got out of prison a few months ago and came back here. The idea was to sell this place but he has LITERALLY taken it over with his ""friends"" that's all drug addicts including him. I myself have been sober since 2017 so it's that much worse. My mom is currently paying the electric and water bills and my brother gives these ppl free range of this place. I come out of my room and there's ppl idk doing whatever they want in my home and he just let's them. There's noooo food bc they eat it. He is extremely violent and has ange4 issues so when he's confronted we LITERALLY fight. When I say something to these ppl they go and tell him and of course the 2 of us fight more. The plan was or so I thought was that we would have had sold this place already but that isn't even close to happening and don't know if it will bc its going to get foreclosed on anytime now. I am going to lose life changing money bc he doesn't give a shit. All he cares about is being the nice guy to his ""friends"" while pleasing them while mom goes without to make sure we have electricity and water and I'm left a prisoner in whats supposed to be my home and my mental state doesn't let me leave my room bc I'm done and over with the verbal and psychical fighting. I hate bothering ppl with my situation bc I don't want to be a ""burden"" on anyone but literally I don't have anyone to ""burden"" and that's part of my problem. It's hard keeping my fingers moving as fast as my thoughts. In my head I knew what I wanted to say and how to word it so hopefully i was able to do that. Hopefully if I didnt you still can make sense of it bc as I'm writing this i have random ppl in my house. I'm soooo mad I'm shaking right now bc 1 of them just took a shower in my bathroom. Ive had things stolen  out of my bathroom and besides they shouldn't be using it period. He has the master bed and bath so they should be using his but he locks his bedroom door so they have to use mine. Anyways I hope I didnt make this sooo long that nobody cares or bothers reading it. With as difficult as it is for me to put this out there especially on social mediaI I'm even more grateful for any and all advice, thoughts, prayers, or anything else that could possibly help out my situation it's greatly appreciated and I can't thank you enough 🥺🥺🥺","Can you report this to his bail officer. You need to get someone to help. Maybe even talk to the police they maybe able to advise you in finding a social worker who can help.

"My mental health has been bad for forty years. it’s worse now than ever despite a levels and writing hundreds of home made books. Getting some work published. I listen to classical music daily and prolifically read and write stories. It ought to be a recipe for a successful life. I don’t regard myself unsuccessful. But my mental health symptoms are as medically serious as many physical health problems. of course I know that in 2024 mh resources are not as good as they should be. I have had lots of psychiatric support but all of it has been done from what my family and I are crying out as being without perspective

I needed one worker to stick with me to get to know me. Instead of a new cpn or ot every two or three months. Like starting reading War and Peace. And after five pages moving on to Oliveri now find it difficult to get any worker. I cannot deny that I’ve had loads of support. Frankly much more than my share I think but even so and it’s throtgh no fault of my own my mental health continues to get worse dramatically and it’s hard even to get that across to staff. I do want to do more than my best. I am always extremely motivated. And I believe my care teams are too. And yet since doing A levels twenty and forty years ago I have never been able to stop all the incessant chaos in my head generating too many confusing thoughts to do a job. It’s extremely painful and frightening. I’m in my fifties. I’ve never been able to do a job and it’s not my fault. I just wonder where to turn to now as my mh workers are disappearing i think to others in need. I still want to do more than my best but feel inclined to think my long term illness and failure to recover must be wholly my fault in view of the good staff I have had. Even if it’s hard ti see a cpn now. My only criticism of them is they’ve changed over so much so as family say they’ve never really got to know me thoygh rhey think they have. I’m more and more determined all the time to recover. But don’t know who to turn to as my mental well being spirals downwards rapidly. I’d really like some advice or suggestions how to get out of this trap that compounds my suffering. And means it’s nigh on impossible to make use of my abilities and skills.

"Hi everyone just me updating on my DCR surgery progress 

Before you ask it stands for 

Dacryocystorhinostomy

Before you also ask what it is it’s when 

“dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgery that creates a new path for tears to drain between your eyes and your nose. You may need this surgery if your tear duct has become blocked. The procedure can be performed externally through an incision in the skin, or endoscopically through the nose without leaving a skin incision.”

I had it done on my left eye 

Pretty brutal but anyways I just went on my 1 month appointment about two days ago my doctor said chances that have spread on my right eye is not impossible but it looks pretty good for now as he checked 

He told me put the eye cream I was using on my eye on the scar incision to help loosen the scab so it will be scar only 

He said I’m doing wonderful for one month and my next appointment is 3 months which means he’ll remove my stent as it’s time it’s bothering me so I’m pretty much recovered if you don’t count the small bruising and the scab scar incision 

I can follow life normally with moderation I’m so relieved 

I’m here crossing my fingers and manifesting my right eye is clear from blockage duct

I suffer from agoraphobia social phobia panic disorder adhd severe depression will any of these things sometimes prevent me from doing what I want does this sometimes prevent motivation how do I fight this off? How do I stop over thinking,"Emotional conflict of PANIC
This is produced from the Depression not assumed, and mostly with medication for a long time.
Sporadic panic, it is the means that a person uses to not feel pressure, especially affective. He/she can't take it anymore; he/she has reached his/her limit. The person with depressive tendencies has unresolved conflicts with his parent of the opposite gender. This explains that very often he attacks his spouse, in whom he establishes the transference. What this person makes his partner feel is what he would have wanted to do to his father or mother, but held back. By refusing help, the depressive person continues to feed his or her resentment or anger towards that parent, and sinks into his or her pain.
The severity of the depressive state reflects the intensity with which the wound was experienced as a child. The wounds can be the following: rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal or injustice To cause a mental imbalance as great as depression and manic-depressive psychosis, the pain had to be lived in isolation. This person had no one to talk to in his childhood, no one to listen to his questions and anxieties. She also did not learn to trust others, she blocked her desires and finally withdrew into herself, while her feeling of resentment or anger increased.

"Its insane to think Im still here after all the crazy bad stuff I have had to live through in my 45 years... must be a reason why?

Broken home, physical and sexual abuse, severe anxiety, depression, cutting, multiple suicide attempts, 10+ year hard drug addiction, alcohol addiction, sex addiction, anger issues, PTSD, being unemployed for long periods, being homeless, being loveless and unable to get laid (In-Cel), toxic relationships, abandonment, being ""Canceled"" on social media, being bullied, toxic family issues, having no friends, severe isolation and loneliness, discrimination, and lots and lots of physical medical problems... Why am I still here???",Good Question. There must be a reason why. They say that there is for everything! Sorry to hear about the life you had growing up. My partner suffered with alcoholism. He liked his wine and his vodka. He is only a similar age to you. He drunk throughout our entire time together which I did not understand why and which threw me. Nothing had worked out for him before. We became engaged and had two children but them children got taken away. We went through a lot together. He fell ill in the end a few years ago with the last year and half at its worst going in and out of hospital all of the time. It was his lifestyle and his lifestyle catching up with him. Nothing could keep him from abstaining. Only god. Not me not his child not his passion or career. Even then our lord our saviour was not enough in the end.,

I'm new to this group , I'm dealing with depression and I hope that I can get some help just for reassurance....

I'm stuck between is it just overthinking or is this really the issue is a lot explain",Hey there! Welcome to the group. I've been in that overthinking vs. real issue loop with depression. It can be a real struggle. What's been a lifesaver for me are microdosing capsules from botanico_remedies on IG. They've added a layer of relief and clarity to my days.

Hey all m worried cos iv got 2 job interviews on Monday 1 at 3 for a react programming job but I don't know react programming and the other is at 4 for a customer service assistant job at wickes but feel like I made a bad impression of myself cos I didn't answer the phone to them so I went up there but I wasn't dressed up but the manager still gave me an interview but said to come as my best self but what's that supposed to me?! Anyway m worried that m not gonna get either of them cos interviews never go well for me 😥,"Hi
I was just asking somebody about the react programming and they said that unless you know JavaScript ,then it probably isn't worth going ,unless of course training is provided . Is it a job based in social media ,e.g Facebook ?
As for the other interview, going as your best self means to show all your best qualities . So I guess be friendly ,polite ,listen well, ask job related questions ,show willingness to learn and any other positive qualities you have.  

(Made the assumption that you don't know JavaScript,which of course you may well do. My apologies).

"Well off to the GP Tommo after writing a letter with all the things that has been going on and needs to be changed on my medical records. As in 2020 February I had what I thought and the GP was a flu or cold but then I had other problems ended up in one hospital and discharged and within a few datmys admitted to another with water on the organs, clot on the lung, liver, kidney problems and heart failure. I had Covid anti bodies and had a independent medical record done as my cardiologist still today said Covid did not cause all this at once.
Due to mental health they blamed overdose, accidental overdose or overdose done by my mom as well as weight lifting etc. Just a joke.
So had 1 and a half years of stress on top of my mental health.
So I have to see him as things are bad and dud to my problems at the time which were considered life limiting, blue badges were given, PIP was increased but still now have problems but can't have long Covid as my medical records say I never had it.
Why do we fight with mental health and they jump at the overdose straight away.
My I dependant report says in a box it was all down to Covid.
It will be a stressful meeting as need my blue badge fir severe anxiety which you can have.
So fingers crossed as my anger problems are not good.","Hi dean very similar happened too me I was told I had cold or flu then rushed into hospital and was going into heart failure fluid on the lungs and my mental health increased that was January this year and suffering with long covid,but now history is repeating it self went Drs the other day as wasn’t feeling well was told it was flu again and today tested positive with covid I find they tell u one thing and say different on paper work I’m fed up fighting my corner all the time like u must too,hope u get it all sorted.",

However, if it gets the upper hand, it wreaks havoc. The test is easy, treatment is antibiotics and you're good to go after that. I have seen på  patients suffer from a host of physical and mental issues recover fully after treatment. If it isn't the case therapy in combination with psilocybin can be a good way to move forward.",

"Four in the morning and I'm sitting here balling my eyes out. I can't keep doing this...in fact I DON'T want to do this society game anymore. I'm so sick of lies fake world fake everything and no one gets it but those that are really hurting. We all have to pretend we are okay we have to pretend that we all going to be okay...well I'm NOT okay.. I am sick and tired of always struggling I'm sick and tired of busting my butt to make ends meet I'm sick and tired of all of it! I've literally survived my whole life and I'm nothing and to be honest very few even care...I'm stating reality and fact not bullcrap like I'm constantly going against. I'm not asking for a pity party I'm asking for real caring love and support.  I've struggled my entire life I've worked so damn hard to live 😭 I finally realized in this society NOPE not gonna happen...I will be screwed over.. judged... Put in my place and destroyed for everything that is me...I'm tired of the contradiction of what we call life. My whole life is no life and a big mess...I can try all I want but where am I going? No where I'm already in hell a fake world with fake everything. Don't get me wrong I did everything I could to pretend I was okay no one has ever really cared. All I've ever wanted was to live no drama just peace but instead I get this a society that destroyed the meaning of life.. it all about control, money, and power, nothing but those things and I'm so done with it. What amazes me is that we the people who make this country run we don't exist we don't matter we are just the slaves that follow and get in line.  🤣🤣 It is what it is. Just remember you think this society would run without us... nope it won't and that's what there afraid of...so tell me this WHY are we suffering so much!???
End rant and merry f ing Christmas",Hi there. Do you need to talk,
Y do we beat ourselves up over the things we done in the past it’s NOT going to change anything I’m really struggling atm to find anything apart from emptyness I’m so confused on what I want as in I want to b happy and loved but I also just want to b with my mum and dad who aren’t here any more life is so messed up and people just don’t understand hell i dont understand wish heaven had a phone,"Hi Wes, of course we beat ourselves up over our past, it's the part of our life we have lived. It's the part we have experienced. I'm sorry you feel the way you do, but joining your mum and dad is deffo not the answer. 
I split with my wife and for the next ten years I punished myself for it. 
I have 2 kids who have both turned out really well, one got a first in uni degree and now doing a PHD so he can be called a Doctor - the other just passed a prestigious make up course and will be attending a BAFTA sanctioned advanced course, when I was at my lowest all I could think of is what I didn't give them, or the times I thought I was mean to them (even though they don't think I was). 
You have to find a way mate, to forgive yourself, for what you think you have done. And if you can't then you have to put into perspective with the rest of your life. Coming to terms with the things we have done, learning from that experience, and then applying that learning to ensure we not only don't repeat them but also we become better people for ourselves and the people we come into contact with. 
The fact you've written this post means you're not a bad person. So allow the good in yourself to surface again, even if it's just one small thing a day like talking to an old person who looks lonely, or looking in the mirror and saying 10 times, ""I forgive you. I am a good person and I like myself."" Or just learning to smile to strangers or children again.",

"So I am told that’s there’s no medical proof to back the prescribing or use of anti psychotics and depression medications as well that there is no proof that they do infact actually work. I am told that doctors say we think it does this to this area of brain but, have no proof that they even work. So I began looking at the side effects of my depression medication and it says they make you have feelings of wanting to commit suicide. So then I asked myself the question why would a doctor prescribe medication that may make me suicidal the one thing I am trying to keep from doing??? Makes no sense to me at all. Does anyone have any feedback for me?","Hi, I just joined this page. I have been wondering the same myself with the medication I’ve been on. I started on Lexapro which made me gain weight even though mentally I did feel more stable on it.

"It is 5:10 am and I spend the whole night awake my lacrimal duct surgery or the official name Dacryocystorhinostomy is tomorrow 
I’m so very nervous I have many thoughts at once 

And one of them is not making it and passing away so I bawled hysterically mom came to my room asked if I was okay I told her she went ”you’re gonna be okay don’t worry it’s not life threatening” 

I don’t know I’m very terrified I never had any surgery before and even having between my left eye and start of my nose sorry I don’t know how to explain please look it up the location it terrifies me 

I know I talk a lot about not being here anymore how I wish or etc because I’m a drams queen but the truth is right now I’m beyond terrified and I don’t want moments before my surgery to be my last time I’m on this earth 

Now I don’t pray but I did talk out loud how I wish I turn out oKay and I wake up and see my mom, my stuffed animals and my room 

I think this awful thing happened for a reason I noticed often I take things for granted I whine out of the most smallest thing and nope no one said this I am 

So I think if I make it out okay I’ll be appreciative of things awhole lot more 

I’ll appriciate more things 

Whenever I feel ungrateful I’ll remember this whole ordeal of the lacrimal duct I’m facing 

I know life sucks and I know we have our moments but never in my life I suffered so bad or cried daily or felt so much agony until lately for the past four months without break 

I manifest after my hour surgery I live many and many more years and see many things eat good food and more 

My mom is beyond kind from spending with me 3 am until now comforting me 

Due to panic attack and shaking she made me chamomile tea with toast 

I hope I sleep today cuz I do have errands to run if not I’ll use positive media to distract me from my thoughts cuz they’re running wild since I’m nervous and scared also terrified for tomorrow",How did your surgery go 🥰,

from my father asking to meet up today  yet he won't care about me  it will be about other siblings or silence,   he is nothing   never going to change. He's getting to be nothing to me,  yet the anger is building. 

My mum said yesterday that she really does appreciate all the work i do to keep the house going,  constantly busy and feel like a maid, she doesn't understand i need help or that im not okay.  

I feel like ive let my nan down,  as i stopped swimming, i miss her,  we used to go once a week,  i still see her and my grandad every other weekend,  yet I really need to get back into swimming.   If not for me,  for time with my nan.

Selfharm erges are definitely on my mind   does it count if you hardly break the skin,   i have had more chances,  more opportunities,  yet my mind goes to let harm myself so I dont have to bottle things up.  

Struggling with having no choice but to keep everything bottled up and hidden,  im NOT okay and its scares me that I can't do anything about it alone.

"I’m looking for a little advice here. I have an almost 4y/o and my husband and I are thinking about trying for baby #2 in the next few months. I feel ready, I’m excited, and this is something I really want. However, I’m terrified. When my son was 6 months old, I was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and I began having really disturbing intrusive thoughts that I was going to intentionally harm him. This kept getting worse and worse as he got older and I ended up in the hospital twice after he turned 3. If convinced myself that if I was around, my baby was in danger, and I wasn’t about to let that happen. I came across a journal I kept during that time (suggested by my therapist), and what I wrote in it is extremely disturbing. I was talking about hating my life, hating my son, hating my husband, etc. 

I’ve been great for 7+ months now, and have spoken with my OB, therapist and psychiatrist who have all cleared me as safe to get pregnant, but I’m still terrified. 

I know no one can tell me what to do, but any advice/experience/opinion is welcome. I want another baby, but I want to make sure myself and everyone I love would be safe if that happened.",I commend you for facing your challenges. It is brave to read your journals and explore how you may have felt in the past. I think your concern for this potential child shows how much you have learned. It sounds like you have a good support system in place. None of us will ever make perfect decisions that have perfect results 100% of the time! We are perfectly imperfect 🥰,

I’ve suffered as well, and I was just thinking how beautiful, intelligent, etc  we all are or can be AMAZING if we can get through this … 

Everyone on these Support pages has some kind of creativity and uniqueness that can help and benefit the next person in this life … we just have to get through this hurdle somehow.
Honestly, my “somehow” is serious prayer and meditation daily. 

—take your time","I completely agree with you. It's so inspiring to see the strength and resilience in everyone here. Your ""somehow"" sounds like a fantastic coping mechanism, and it's wonderful to know that, despite the struggles we face, we still have the power to uplift one another.

"Just a update. I haven't seen my son for 4 weeks  I had a visit booked  today but it's not going ahead they say they have a bug going around on the ward they may have so why do they have to tell me this on the day I'm due  to visit. I spoke to my son yesterday who mentioned if I want to visit I have to phone today to ask if I can visit staff  have just phoned me to tell me I can't visit  today . I can't get into visit now for another 2weeks if I can get a visit has it hasn't been confirmed yet. Each time I visit I watch my son slowly decline in his health it's going to be sometime before I visit so how will he be the next time i see him I'm unsure. On my sons call yesterday I could tell my son wanted to speak with me about something has I could hear him mumbling to staff this kept happening throughout the call he would go quiet then mumble something so I'm unsure what he wants to say but staff wouldn't allow him to tell me. Rampton control him they listen to calls tell him  what to say and what not to say they are very controlling. They don't allow me has part of his care so I don't know anything about my son. They don't allow me reports, or information from ctrs tribuneral that I have attended yet they hear my son telling me has all calls are recorded that he wants me to have all information . A few months ago my son self harmed they failed to tell me. They failed to tell me he spent 5days in hospital. My son doest self harm he was in seclusion at the time due too having been upset  on the ward has the noise gets to him also he tells me he feels targeted has others see him has vulnerable. I have complained many times through safeguarding, pals, but nothing is taken seriously.",I don't know your situation but can you bring your son home? Can you get a lawyer on legal aid to support you and your son? Can you complain to the person who runs the home or the health board or social work? Good luck my dear,
My cousins all 21 and above invited me(20 In two weeks) out with they're friends to hang out on NYE and to celebrate. I agreed. I got a text two days later (sat Dec 31st)  saying I couldn't go because they're going to be hitting up a bunch of bars and clubs. I am emotionally mature for my age and carry myself with responsibility. So Naturally they didn't think to ask how old I was and assumed I was of age and found out from My aunt (his mother). I am in no way angry or mad but I have a heavy sense of rejection and dread due to RSD (Rejection sensitivity dysphoria) and I'm having a hard time managing my feelings. Any advice?,"I don't normally slide into DM,s strictly only when the universe permits ase🧿🙏⭐",
"Hi guys
Id like peeps input on the following question. I'm not after medical advice, just suggestions to put to the DR.
QUESTION:
If you’ve had a breakdown/psychotic episode which cost you your job, or significant time off work, how did you successfully return to work?
What drug regimen did the DR put you on ie Propranolol, Diazepam, Sertraline etc?
Were there other strategies you employed that successfully got you back to work?

The conversation of stages

Said life to death on the day they met ""you take away as you please""

Death replied with a sigh ""Perhaps that’s why, you are known as only temporary""

""The glitters you show captures most who don’t know, or those wondering aimlessly
When the time has come; to end the clouded fun, they return to where they ought to be"".

So life takes a minute to see within it and realises what death had seen.

That if one was inept without using intellect, the result follows productivity.",

"Hello all. I hope this time of year is being kind to you and you are being kind to yourselves. So, Iam not sure exactly what it is I am asking, I suppose any lived or carer experience, or just general advice. My daughter (17) is really struggling with her mental health. It’s new to all of us, her particular issue. About 4-6 weeks ago, she had her first episode of what I think is depersonalisation (DPDR). It was very scary, I took her to see an out of hours GP, but essentially they thought stress related to A-levels. After about a week of being an outsider in her own life, she came around, the fog lifted and she was back to normal and it was all but forgotten about. 

7 days ago, it started again. I think perhaps linked to working (her pt job) more hours than she normally would - five days in a row and having mocks when she returns to college after Christmas. She is fed up (to put it mildly) with looking from the outside in on her life, not feeling anything, and having no joy, which is tough given it’s Xmas day! She said today she wants to die, although a fleeting thought, I hope! She gave up opening presents and we’ve stayed at home rather than going to my sisters for lunch as planned. I am so sad for her. I am anxious, concerned, and feel helpless. Does anybody have lived or other experience of DPDR (self (by me) diagnosed? I’ve been reading and can see some people stay this way for months/years, others it’s fleeting. Can anybody give any advice, reassurance? I will make her a GP appointment. Should we defer A-levels for a year, stop her working? What do you think? Thank you 🙏.",I had depersonalisation under heavy stress a few times it's very scary but mine only lasted hours.  I hope your daughters symptoms ease off.  But yes she probably needs a good rest physically and mentally best wishes,

I can say medication has helped a lot, it is still intrusive but nowhere close to what it was off of medication.  I had challenges getting my providers to do anything for me initially also, but I just kept bringing up how disruptive it was and that it wasn't going away until after a few years my doctor finally prescribed something that was helpful.  I'm sure it's challenging for you to deal with, but hang in there until you are heard.  Once you are able to find the right doctor and medication it will get a lot easier.",

I started wearing my smart watch again but I'm not wearing it to bed sod that the last time I did that i got a shock apparently my heart rate was 140bpm not sure what i was doing while i was asleep.,"I once believed that my beloved spouse was the epitome of perfection. Little did I know, beneath her charismatic facade, she was a master manipulator, distorting reality to satisfy her own selfish desires. Lost and disoriented, I desperately year for a glimpse of the truth. Then, by chance, I stumbled upon a mysterious expert online. Desperate for answers, I sought out his assistance, and it turned out to be a life-changing revelation! With his unmatched skills, he fearlessly delved into the intricate web of deceit, monitoring my wife's actions through her phone and covertly examining her WhatsApp conversations. That was the moment when my world crumbled. I discovered that my beloved wife had been secretly meeting with young individuals, betraying me without remorse. The anguish I felt was indescribable, amplified by the realization of the abuse and silent suffering I had endured. It was a harsh awakening that left me shattered. But I refuse to let this story end in despair. As a survivor of such treacherous depths, I urge you, esteemed reader, to pay heed to my narrative. Countless individuals find themselves trapped in similar webs of deception, living in the shadows of manipulative narcissists. That is why I wholeheartedly recommend the elusive guru who unraveled my truth. If you too desire to reclaim your reality, don't hesitate to reach out to him. The key to liberation is within your grasp. Connect with him on his Facebook page, Sift Forensics and embrace the power of truth to break free from the clutches of deception.

"Non-inclusion of individuals with ADHD in educational institutions often escalates rapidly due to a lack of education and awareness, fostering an environment ripe for discrimination. Ignorance surrounding ADHD can result in educators and peers misunderstanding the challenges faced by those with the condition. The absence of accommodations and tailored support exacerbates the difficulties these individuals encounter, hindering their academic progress and overall well-being. Without proper education about ADHD, educators may misconstrue symptoms such as impulsivity or inattention as intentional misbehavior, leading to punitive measures rather than supportive interventions.

Moreover, the ignorance surrounding ADHD may contribute to a pervasive lack of empathy among peers, fostering an atmosphere of exclusion. Students with ADHD may face social isolation, bullying, or marginalization due to their differences, further impeding their sense of belonging within the educational community. As a consequence, the rapid spiral from non-inclusion to discrimination unfolds, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage for individuals with ADHD within the educational system. Urgent efforts are needed to dismantle these barriers through awareness programs, inclusive policies, and tailored support to ensure that individuals with ADHD have equal opportunities to thrive in educational environments.","I previously struggle with ADHD, OCD intrusive thoughts, anxiety and depression for years but since I was introduced to herbert_tripper on Instagram who is a professional mycólògist my life has improved so much. I think you should try it too. 🥰",
"I am an international student. I have no friends. I live with the people who do what they want. They don't even let me sleep. I feel like I am not worth it here anymore. I've been struggling for 7 months. Don't know what to do. I feel sick. I have no one to talk to. If I try to talk to my roommates, they don't even listen. They make me do what they want. I'm tired.

"Has anyone (after speaking to a Dr) been successful in coming off pharmaceutical medications and been able to maintain wellness and recovery, through other natural avenues including clean eating, regular enjoyable exercise, therapy, EMDR, natural oils, massage, reiki, mindfulness, meditation , Thai chi, acupuncture, and other natural alternatives like St John's wort and valerian?
I am very hesitant to go back to terrible depression. I have several opinions/diagnosis.. never really leading anywhere. Deemed treatment resistant. I've had ECT over the years 
The medications I've been on over the years have never really worked. Some have had horrendous side effects.
I'm on two antidepressants and I am the biggest I have ever been. It happened very quickly and getting worse. My weight is so bad it's effecting my mobility.
Now my therapist also thinks I was misdiagnosed for 15 years and I actually have always just had adult ADHD. She thinks I can be treated and she is very hopeful for me.
I want to believe that this can be beaten with a positive mindset and it's achievable but what if it really is a chemical imbalance.
Over the years I've spent the majority of my life severely depressed and at times suicidal. To the point I wouldn't shower I would stink.
They have written me off as borderline, other professionals thought CPTSD (I agree with this one) and bipolar 2. Yet never responded to one antidepressant or mood stabilizer just made things worse. Big cocktails of medications too and I mean my body is paying for it now. I never responded to one mood stabilizer or antidepressant in 15 years they didn't know why. Another professional also said Skizoeffective (can't spell sorry) so add every different anti psychotic to the list. They actually made me psychotic.
I'm looking forward to the EMDR. I had this thing happen recently where my whole brain shut down from trauma and I was very very sick. Everything was delayed. Things around me didn't make sense. I couldn't follow the TV. I didn't understand people taking to me. It happened for ages I kind of left my body and it was like severe dissociation. It was the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me.
Anyway I feel very alienated by the world so I feel like it's time to reach out to my people that don't judge because they get it.
Just looking to make connections
 Has anyone tried these things, can anyone relate to any of this or had similar experiences","I support people on medication , I could easily have something myself even be it hormonal.  I don't like approaching Dr's I have a phobia, I turn to natural support if I can find the right one, its  far quicker and I have actually recently had issue with a family member and completely uncomfortable with the meds offered. It has caused family tension but I'm sticking to my guns, although  feeling a bit isolated. I think we need to be more open in society and talk far more on mental well being, we all have our wobbles, we just don't all have diagnosis.  We always suggest talking helps but actually that is actually quite hard to find. If people feel supported by meds and it's controlled well my personal belief go for it and vice versa, really ideally we should all have the opportunity to be ok.",

Sorry in advance if this is too much.

I’m new here. Don’t exactly know what to expect. I don’t know. Just really struggling with life in general and nobody to talk to about it. I can’t leave the house or barely leave the house… only when absolutely necessary. My stress amd anxiety are through the roof. I see all my faults, flaws and daily failures and it’s just bringing me deeper and deeper into my depression. I don’t really find enjoyment in life anymore. I often find myself wishing I would catch some horrible disease or something that would just off me quickly. I don’t know.. I’ve gotten to the point where I just don’t care anymore. I already struggle with epilepsy and all the crap that comes with that for 10+ years. I see others with so much worse situations and I can’t help but think how weak I am. I’ve just stopped caring about everything.","I understand what your saying, I only leave my property to go food shopping once a week, that is enough interaction with the world, I know that if I was told I had cancer etc. I would refuse all treatment,  I like most of us on here have had my fair share of crap in my life from a young age.

Like are you trying to get me to isolate myself? Do you want me to go crazy is that what you want? 

I hate pointing fingers out here but I’m pretty sure I have no friends because of you and I sabotaged some friendships was because of you

Never listen to your parents specially if their similiar to mine who tries to ruin your life","I want you just to know that people can try to break us but end of the day it’s our decision how we react to it, and if we allow them. You might not agree with your mum, but you can’t blame her for everything. If she is so awful maybe it’s time to move out, you obviously don’t want to live with toxic person. 
And also I think nothing broken  that can’t be fixed, but it won’t happen on its own. So if you feel like you had good friends you can always reach out and apologise and try again. It’s an effort that counts.",

What about you?,I've learned that I can't fix it all in one day. Take it slow but don't give up. That we are ALL human and we ALL go through good and bad days. Key is on those bad days rather it's feeling down on myself or if I'm missing a loved one I Take time to miss them cry if I need to then think of the good memories and keep moving forward. I think in life we need balance.,
"On the off chance, I don’t suppose anyone knows anything about employment law/disability discrimination?

I’m appealing a work dismissal due to direct disability discrimination, and my preferred outcome would be a settlement agreement. I was in my probation period but Acas have told me that my rights are the same regardless if I believe my dismissal is due to discrimination. 

Does anyone have an outline of how much financial compensation I could push for? I know that if I took them to tribunal it could end up costing the company a lot of money, but not sure what’s a reasonable amount in a settlement agreement. 

Thank you x","I've taken two to trial and you'll need to get a solicitor. The first one I was immediately offered 5000 I had a strong case. They didn't want it to go to trial and did that before any acas or anything . The second was a non starter not strong enough case. I'm inclined to think if they believed youd win they would have already made an offer. So, a solicitors advice would be better and if your unable to get one there's no viable case.",

I am now starting to regret my decision. I have still not received a diagnosis after 5 years of trying.

"I truly think I'm just done caring...that's what hurts me the most. I've spent my entire life caring for others I've tried so hard to be loved when in reality I am, always will be, and completely alone.  I'm married I have two kids and none of them care...I was adopted into a huge family yet NO one cares.  You open up you try to express too all those who you think are your family or even half ass friends but yet again NO ONE cares on top of not just not caring but all of a sudden they judge you on top of not caring...omg he/she is and alcoholic or a druggy or a disappointment or blaa blaaa list goes on...funny how everyone abandoneds you and tells you oh it's all you it's your problem not ours you did this too yourself...and on top of that our society of we want to help here is September month of suicide prevention but yet again NO one really cares at least us in the worst situations trying to rely on family or friends to help us through our hardest times but yet THEY are NOT there.  I for one is done I will and always be done...no I didn't choose this no I didn't even ask to be born in this violent crap society but I've pushed through I've struggled I've had consistently been up and down but yet I am one of the most caring humans out there to those that are like me...ya all my husband didn't like it but I told him like it is tonight and yes he doesn't care but I f ing care and I struggle everyday to survive each day! Ask your supposed folks that supposedly care this...what you gonna do when I'm in my grave...all of a sudden care!?? Please don't! You don't care now don't come near me when I'm gone!!",I’m so sorry you are experiencing this. Have you been able to connect to a therapist in your area?,
"Can I hear about your personal experiences with Bupropion (Wellbutrun)? I'm so nervous about trying it that I'm crying and almost having a panic attack over it. I have a heart defect. And I already deal with jitters, heart palpitations and insomnia. I'm so afraid of these side effects I won't even drink strong coffee that's not diluted with a lot of cream. It sucks because I'm overweight and would really love to take something that would also help with weight loss. I'm just sure there's no way I could take this without being miserable. 😢","I’ve been taking buPROPion XR at the highest dose for almost 10 years. It was the first antidepressant I tried when I had severe major depressive disorder, and it may have saved me. My psychiatrist has changed my other prescriptions over the years, but I joke that buPROPion has become something like mother’s milk to me. Everyone is different, and I’m sure there are folks who had a very different experience than me. Please work with your doctor to find out what is best for you.",
"The doctor prescribed Concerta (methylphenidate) for me, knowing that I didn't have ADHD. It is a supportive medicine for depression and for the treatment of lack of motivation and activity .. Has anyone tried this medicine? Does it really have very annoying side effects such as anxiety, nausea, nervousness and lack of appetite?","I’ve had social anxiety for a long time and I think that part of living with social anxiety is learning to accept the unsure part and learning to dismiss the doubtful thoughts. I’m currently not in therapy but I am on Lexapro which does help some. 
I would suggest a therapist like michael_tripyy on Instagram that specializes in OCD/anxiety disorders and to get on medication. Mine has completely gone away and I have learned to recognize the intrusive, upsetting thoughts and live! Hope you can too.",

Anyone else just not excited for Christmas this year??? I haven’t been for a few years now.

"I've been vegan for 5 years, and due to some recent health issues, I've had to start eating meat again (hopefully only short term). Last night I went out for food with my family for the first time in 2 months (due to the illness) and because I cannot have any vegetables right now, I had venison and chips - first time I've had venison in over 5 years!
And then on the way home, my boyfriend and I hit a deer in our car. I saw the deer land and it was still moving and trying to get up (sorry for being graphic) but we couldn't stop because it was a national speed limit road and we were on a blind bend. And even if we did stop, what could we do? We had nothing to put it out of its misery.
I am completely devasted by this and cannot stop replaying it in my head. I can't believe we left it there, in pain. I called the police to report it and hopefully, if it was alive when they got there, they'd call a wildlife warden.
I feel like this is some karmic punishment because I ate venison. Logically I know that's stupid, but I've been struggling mentally to deal with my illness anyway, eating meat again and then this happens. Why did this have to happen? All the years I've spent driving country roads and never hit anything, and this has to happen right now. I feel like I can never forgive myself. And my illness is triggered by stress, not only am I mentally struggling, but my body is reacting as well and making me feel worse.
Sorry for the long post.",It's not karma.. it's just a coincidence. Sometimes things happen in such a way that it just seems crazy like 'wow this happened right after I ate that?!'.. and like on a post I just made.. when we have mental health issues our mind wants us to focus on the negative. It's like you said.. what could you have done? You can't go back and make it not happen. If it survived it will probably get help now that you reported it. If it died it will feed a quite a few animals.,

"I believe one of my pills has caused over two decades of taking them to produce autistic like effects. I don't mind being diagnosed autistic in late middle age except that I am absolutely certain that the resemblances between my condition which has always been diagnosed as schizo-affective disorder and autism are created by one of the medicines I'm on which in my case over a long period of time I think has affected the clarity of my thinking and in other ways enhanced it. I think people are preparing me to receive a diagnosis of autism - I have no objection to this but I would wager a lot on the belief that the best consultant would recognise that it only describes me in terms of a diagnosis as the person I've become through long term use of a specific medicine that has been used to control mood stability. Even though a diagnosis of schizo affective disorder is not exactly pleasant I think it's closer to the truth.     My real worry is that some pills I've been on have affected my thinking patterns and it upsets me because I now feel if I could have come off these pills earlier - and I begged the doctors for twenty years because I hated the effects they were having - I couldnt study or concentrate after taking them - which I feel is only a specific effect they have had on me. I feel very indignant that I should receive a new diagnosis which I am absolutely certain represesnts a condition which either appears to be present or has actually be generated/induced by long term effects of one of my pills. I believe the former - that my pills have created a new set of symptoms or characteristics and I am frustrated because the ideal situation would be for a doctor to acknowledge that any new medical condition or difficulty has been entirely created by the treatmnet of my original and I think correct diagnosis.

Im not averse to an autism diagnosis except that I feel absolutely certain that its not correct and that any similarities between my symptoms and autism have been entirely created by this medicine and I don't want the doctors to be able to just label me with a new psychiatric condition each time the long term effect of their medicine has produced an undesirable effect(s)       If my doctors do say I'm autistic - can I challenge it  - not because I fear it but because I think its inaccurate in my case and it feels strongly like a coverup though unintended for a lot of medical errors in keeping me on a pill for too many years.  I am worried that this may happen more often in society   that as I say  - when pills give an unintended effect or undesirable effect the care team don't say this was caused by the treatment instead doctors appear to look for a  new diagnosis. That worries me and if its what is happening as I greatly fear seems to be a frightening situation","it's very common to be autistic & also have a pd - autism is genetic but some chemicals can ""slow down"" the brain, kinda like medication for ADHD causing the symptoms to be more obvious 

you can indeed challenge your diagnosis - you know your body & mind better than anyone",

Why does it feel like I'm not doing enough when I'm trying my best with my limited physical abilities. I feel like I have failed as a person and as a mother. My daughter is 21 and my son is 16. Why do people think it is wrong for me to ask them to help with the bills. I was working and helping out around the house when I was 15. I was made to do chores and things around the house.

"I’ve lost everything as of this moment. Addiction, depression, and trying to hold everything in to make it seem like nothing is wrong. These three things have led me to losing everything but the roof over my head. The only two people that were there for me and meant anything, my wife(not legally) and my son, are officially not part of my life as of tonight. And it’s my fault. No denying that. I pushed, pushed, and pushed them away so they didn’t see me for what I am. A addict. Not realizing there wasn’t any real way to hide it from them. I had to choose them or the demons a while back. And I tried. I seriously tried my hardest. But I fell back into my own trap. I needed support and love but I had already made that impossible a long time ago. I straightened up for a bit. But it was already too late. So I jumped back on the highway to hell. I chose wrong. And I can’t change that. The tracks are running out though. And jumping off doesn’t seem like a possibility.

"Hi, I’m hoping that someone can help me.. my husband could possibly have schizophrenia. He was recently admitted to hospital involuntarily after experiencing a psychotic episode and was on medication but has since stopped taking it because he didn’t like the side affects, however he’s still experiencing delusions and is in denial about everything. He is functioning fine now and says he has it under control, but im worried as I don’t know what to do… hospital visit and medication is not an option, are there other ways I can help him?","Just as spencer said above, the only possible draw back is that as he's an adult, if he refuses the doctors at the hospital or your doctors to give you any information, then unless he's been the a MCA (mental capacity assessment) and deemed not to have capacity, then he has to be treated as he has, this doesn't help you, although they could be a flip side and that is there maybe a Multi-discipline team meeting, where all parties to do with his care once out of hospital, I'm going to say if he is given that diagnosis he will be discharged into the CMHT ( community mental health team). This is of course if your based in the UK. But they should be measures put in place before the release him",

"Hi everyone. I'm thankful to get the chance to be in this group. I suffer from mental illness, bipolar, depression and debilitating anxiety and PTSD from domestic violence and chilhood trauma from growing up in my dad's hoarder house. My anxiety is very severe. It's cost me relationships and hospitalizations since I was 15 years old. My father would call me a crazy lunatic and my parents put me away in a hospital at 15 and didn't even want to come get me out. I feel alone and abandoned. Nobody loves me in this world. 😔 

 My kids hate me and are embarrassed of me. I have been dependant on Benzodizapines for 10 years now. I try to stop and my doctor is weaning me off but it is hell in my mind getting off of it. She said she's going to stop giving them to me soon and it is hell when I don't have any benzos left, I can't sleep. I have severe insomnia and up for days at a time without the klonopin. I'm never gonna be free from benzo withdrawal. It's hell when I don't have any benzo. I lost my sister to heroin overdose last year, and my mom to cancer 3 years prior to my sisters death. I've never done heroin myself and I will never be like my sister. I'm angry and hurt by her for doing that to us, my nieces and my kids. 

Why is my doctor taking it away if it helps me? Without it I have nightmares and heart palpitations when I run out of my klonopin I get hell in my mind without it and I cant stop or I'll die from the withdrawal and anxiety I have. My doctor doesn't care she is taking me off of it after being on it for over 9 years 😪 What am I suppose to do about the tortures hell in mind after she stops prescribing it to me?",Keep fighting.

I have overcome a lot of my issues after almost a lifetime but I live in isolation because I just can't seem to connect with people.","Life is an oddity, some see the brutality and others the magnificence.

"Hi guys, 

I wanted to share something with you and maybe someone will know the answer. I apologize beforehand for the long post!
Long story short, I have been dealing with mental health issues for the last 20 years. And I have lost count of the number of friends I lost after they learned, one way or another, that I have this type of issues.
What is bothering me is why - I don't talk about my illness to them. I always support everyone. But, this year I had to go on sick leave because I wasn't mentally capable of working, and when a couple of friends visited us, they asked me what happened and I just said it was because of anxiety but I am working through it and that was it. I didn't go into details nor I ever would. I just said it like it was no big deal and moved the conversation onto another topic. 
But what happened is that it's been six months since that day (it was my daughter's birthday they came to, that is why I remember) and since then both couples slowly ended their communication, to put it that way with both my husband and me. We haven't seen them since then.
I am confused - I don't talk to anyone about it. I don't ask people for advice. I don't make scenes. I don't complain. I don't ask for anything from  anyone. So, why did they run the moment I mentioned I had a mental health issue? 
This is the umpteenth time this is happening and I am tired of taking someone as a friend, and then realizing that they do not see me that way. I have never run from anyone who had physical or mental issues, I did my best to help. But why, when I need friends the most, they step away and shut me out?
My husband advised me not to say anything to them and act like everything is normal, so I am asking here - what did I do wrong?",Maybe try asking them but please don’t feel like you have to be lesser than your whole true self with people.  If they don’t accept you how you are then they’re not part of your tribe and that’s sad for them.,

He has a shocking lack of respect for me - he's not like it around anyone else. He won't get under his weighted blanket when I ask him to if he's starting to meltdown; won't go on the naughty step when he's told. Won't tidy up as he didn't make all the mess - we have a toddler too.

"I feel like a weirdo?

I will say, I do suffer from mental health issues and trauma, so I think what I am about to share has something to do with it.

I feel like a weirdo because I cannot feel love. I seem to lack the ability to feel ANY type of love. People always say you should love family and friends, right? But no matter what I do or try, I cannot seem to feel that spark that everyone else does. My brain knows that I should love and care for them, but there is nothing in my chest, I feel nothing. I feel nothing when I see them sad, worried, or anything of the sort. But I still try to help them cause my brain knows that I should care, love, and help, you know?

For the longest time, I thought I was either bi or pan cause I never really had a preference on who to date. I thought that what I was feeling was love, I thought I had a crush on these people, but I didn't. If anything, it was more like interest to be their friend (the 'Oh, hey, they look cool. I'm lonely and should make friends' kind of interest). I only realized that it wasn't love or a crush when the people around me started to describe how they feel around their crushes. Butterflies in my stomach? No. Think about them often? No. Nervous around them? No.

This lack of love applies to my hobbies, to food, to the smallest things like color or music. I only say I love writing cause I have skill for it, but I don't even write often and I do not have the feelings that a writer should have for writing. I only say I love blue because I feel like a weirdo without a favorite color when everyone has one. I always see people stanning their favorite groups/bands/artists like BTS, Nirvana, Ariana Grande, etc,. Yet I cannot seem to find a single one that I feel connected to. Regardless of what or who it is, I do not feel care or love towards them.

This lack of love applies to myself as well. Obviously, I still have emotions like sadness, anger, disgust, happiness... But the topic of love is hard for me precisely because of what I mentioned above. What are your thoughts?",My dear if you feel alright you don't need to feel love. Behave as if you love the people you look after. Be kind be gentle and listen. Say the right things. Cuddle. Sing dance. Feelings are just feelings. Behaviour is what matters. Some people feel love but don't know how to show it. Good luck. You are alright.,
"Hi... My life is really weigheing on me... I can't handle the stress since My ex left me...
Too many problems, and... My back hurts so much, just been crying and crying all night because a friend was mean to me.
No one is empathetic because I have this or that. I havent u know... Because I feel like it would suck if I we're to survive.","My dear, your life is very precious and you have the right to live a stress free and peaceful life. There are two major ways to handle issues that life throws at us: 
You either RESPOND or REACT.
You simply REACTED to the ugly situations that befell you instead of RESPONDING to them.
Responding to situations means:
- To put the situations in perspective between you and yourself and disect it. That is analyze it to bring out the good side and the bad sides of the situation. You will always discover that the good side is always more than the bad side. 
- Practice THANKFULNESS. Always be thankful for every situation that you find yoirself. That is when the situation will make you stronger and become stepping stones to your next higher level of happiness in life. Thank God that it is your ex that left you and not your life that left you. You still have a very big robust life of joy ahead of you to live. 
- Practice meditation. Meditate on the issues to acknowledge and be encouraged by the positive sides of the issues. 
- Whenever you are getting stressed, sit on a chair and do breathing exercise for a few minutes. Breath in deeply, hold for a few seconds, and breath out completely. Repeat till you begin to feel relaxed.",
"Hi guys. I hope you’re all doing ok. I just wanted to say as well that it’s amazing we have this group, nobody should suffer alone right! 

I’ve had the 2 years from hell if I’m honest, my mental health is pretty bad I think. I have some good days, but they feel like window dressing, nothing more. The latest ”event” was my relationship ending a few months back. We had been together 4 years but she finally had enough of me bottling things up and dragging her down with me. I’m in a course of therapy sessions and I think they’re helping, I’m also giving yoga a go which I’m not convinced is a good idea at 40 but hey! What’s the worst that could happen. 

I find myself thinking about what comes next, should this cloud ever go. I’m scared about who I’ll be and sometimes I even find myself not wanting the cloud to go.  
The other thing I’m struggling with is filling time, I don’t have a huge friends circle, and the ones I do have all have their own lives and I’m not comfortable with dumping my problems on them. 
I haven’t had anything remotely close to intimacy with anyone yet since the breakup , I know it’s still early but I kind of don’t want to. Is it normal to think I’m safer on my own?

At first, he said it was traffic. but at some point, he started keeping his phone away from me and started complaining and raising tantrums. whenever I brought up the topic. I started suspecting he was cheating and confronted him. He said, ""you're just making up stories because of your low level of thinking.""

But he is constantly blaming me for what happened in the past. I sincerely apologized to him but  everyday he blames me and asks why I didn't improve myself earlier. He is saying that he tried to be involved with another woman but failed to form a bond as he loves me. But he is traumatized by the relationship and doesn't want to come back to me.

"TRIGGER WARNING ( mention of alcohol, Abuse, Rape and hospital

Last night I went to a hallween house party at my best friends house.
We were all drinking and having a good time.
Until her brother turned up. . .

Her brother spotted me out of the crowed and came over to me.

He asked me if I wanted to go talk in his room away from everyone else.
I said no
So he went to go ask someone else.
They also said no
So he got angry and ended up lashing out at me and 2 of my friends.
He smashed a glass table over my head and knocked me out. 

My best friend asked everyone to leave at this point. She showed everyone to the door.

By the time she got back her brother had picked me up and took me to his bedroom. . . .
I woke up covered in blood and with my hands tided to the headboard of his bed i was completely nacked he was on top of me. . .

So I've been in the hospital getting a rape tests done blood tests done and doing a stament to the police. 

I feel completely worthless empty and numb. . . So meny people from the party have said I deserved what happened. . .

Hi everyone, UK only please? So I'm assuming everyone else had the same issues with getting a proper MH diagnosis via the NHS. I've struggled with severe MH issues since my teens, I have always been managed (if you can call it that, with pretty much every SSRI/SSNI known. They don't work, none, infact a few of them (specifically Fluxoetine (Prozak) made me so bad that I attempted suicide)) - of course I was admitted to A&E escaped hospitalisation, as I was dual diagnosis with substance abuse issues as well as unstable moods - so the underlying cause has always been ignored and the drugs were given the blame. I have battled for years to get a proper Phyciatric assessment, but always get given a new smartie to try or a dosage increase. Needless to say, I'm not going to wait until I get so unstable I'm hospitalised or I end up in the ground, so Im going to have to pay for a private diagnosis. Has anyone else had this experience? If so, can you recommend someone that is going to give me the help I need and not clean me out please? Thanks in advance.",Sending love 💓 Alex take care,

"Today I'm thinking about my life and the difficulties at times,
sometimes it's just rain and clouds, then suddenly I'll see the sunshine.

Small things can mean so much, 
a smile, a joke or a touch, don't stress too much if you're down, then again you don't have to be the clown.

Tomorrow is another day, to be enjoyed or endured,
keep moving forward - nothing stays the same, for sure.

Look out for others and help them if you can,
otherwise it's meaningless and alone was never part of the plan.

Take a minute to reflect on everything around,
nature, animals, a book or play,
so much to choose, your choice to be found.

If you see me smiling bravely through the pain,
I keep a lot hidden, it's all part of the game.

We have so much, we can be active and that's all I'll say,
everyone together finding their way.",That is so beautiful and true xxx 🧡🧡,

My reply was “take your time do not be pressured on  your progress with anything, im not sure how you sct but dont worry about if “I’m mature enough” women Is not usuallyvknown for maturing at their 30’s or later even so dont worry about i even have my Immature moments sometimes, do not worry what society tells you like if you should already be married of have kids thats society telling you so do not hop into the matrix you do your own thing” 

And with that id love to give you all this advice but she was like “thanks thats comforting” was the most heart warming thing ever to hear i love love love helping people specially if i pick your vibe and see its worth it makes me so incredibly happy","That’s great advice.

Idk what’s happening to u so I’m sorry if this will put more weight on u but ima share cuz why not 

So today while running errands since bc of this eye mess( Lacrimal tear duct blockage) I fear of washing my hair and getting shampoo into my eyes it’s not enough I’m almost having eye pain daily and stinging 

So we decided to hop onto my hairstylist 

I noticed my bangs were getting too big but I wanted to trim them 

So I asked the lady 

Mistake bc I cut better hair than her and she doesn’t know how to cut 

Lemme see if I can describe the flaw she did she cut out fine but left too big pieces sticking out so I politely asked to correct idk what she understood I’d cut my bang but I fear going in my eye with current problem I’m facing 

So she cut 

I only asked those two long pieces make them match the lenght 

She cut all short to where my bang won’t go down… im so upset I looked in the mirror I nearly cried 

Luckily bangs grow fast but it does take time a bit so now it’s horrible :/",That’s terrible. I paid to get my hair cut in layers and it is all uneven and frizzy now. My hair has never been frizzy. My hair doesn’t grow fast either.,

"Hi ladies! 
I know you guys are all very supportive and caring.  So I have stage 4 endometriosis and have been having a lot of pain lately because of my mental health so here’s the story: 
I breed mini Goldendoodles.  It is my main income.  I had a lady on my waitlist wanting a puppy from me.  When the litter was here the momma only had a singleton.  The sad part was the father of the puppy died the day he was born.  I was super heartbroken😞 I was planning on keeping him because of the incident.  But I realized I couldn’t keep another so I messaged the lady back saying he was yours if you’re still interested.  She proceeded on purchasing him.  
Fast forward now she has the dog.  I realized this lady has been messaging me on a regular basis.  I had a post at the bottom of my insta feed-(I have about 200 posts)with a pride flag and she found out I was into girls and sent me a message. So we started talking quite a bit but then I noticed she got hot and cold with me and she even admitted she wanted me to chase her.  I didn’t want to chase her so I gave up and met a new girl and posted her and she got mad about it.  I barely know her and she says comments like “sweet dreams💕” “how’d you sleep💕?” “You’re cute” replies to most of my Instagram stories.  We live far away from eachother-about 17 hours!!
Fast forward to last week- it was very hard for me to know what she wanted from me.  As soon as me and my gf broke up she slides up on my story asking what happened!  
And now we got into a big fight knowing it wasnt going to work out.  I really just wanted to be cool with her and not end on bad terms since she did get a pup from me.  I’ve been extremely nice to her, almost too nice.  She was very nice to me at first then switched up on me when I had a girlfriend.  I did visit her and the puppy on new years and of course she was my new years kiss.  She seemed so happy and wanted to be friends and see where it goes. And now she’s extremely mean and defense when I ask how she and the pup are doing.  I feel really bad.  I had to block her off social media since it was getting to be too much.  
I feel so traumatized right now!! And felt like I was abused by her emotionally:(  she’s trying to switch things up and call me the bad guy.  I really liked her. It’s bothering me so much.  I’m super heartbroken it came to this😞. My pain has been awful and keep having breakdowns.  What would be the best coping mechanisms to overcome emotional abuse ?
Sorry for the long paragraph! Just asking for ideas on how to overcome this trauma:(",They pushing your buttons so you act crazy. This unfortunately got the worst of me when you snap. Pause yourself. It don't matter. Believe it and continue with your life you have alot to live for,

"Get the mask off… 🖤 Behind the facade of the smile! 

Smiling depression is a real thing, and it’s dangerous. The sadness of a frown could never compare to the hopeless truth behind the mask.

It’s not that hard to do, it’s easy to rise in the morning with the mask firmly in place, and go about the routine of maintaining everyone else’s happiness.

It’s a simple dance, step-by-step placement of the right words at the right time. A smile is always the icing on the cake, assuring that things are as they should be….. but they’re not are they? 

Get the mask off! Talk to a friend, a family member and start to put on your own FACE! … the journey will be tough but YOU CAN DO IT

"Hey lovelies I have wonderful news 

So today was my post op appointment to remove my eye stent from surgery 

It got removed 

It went well 

It hurt like heck 
Felt like being hit with a rubber band 

But I can do stuff normally such going out and etc 

However 3 weeks from now I have one to check how things are going 

And if my right eye( the other one) doesn’t have anything 

I’m really highly hoping we’re done with all of this and the right eye tear duct didn’t get effected due to them being connected and my left eye( which is the one that had surgery) is doing wonderful 

Also also 

I saw reviews online of this sushi place near us and today we tried

We found a local sushi place to always eat 

So ye life is going amazing 

The leaking stopped the moment the stent was removed 

I feel now as if it didn’t have any surgery or anything I feel pretty normal 

I’m amazed how fast my body heals 

Everything is normal within 5 months 

It was hard really hard but worth it 

Yeah I complain about stuff sometimes but this process made me appreciate and romanticize life more beefier I’d say very dark stuff about my existence nowadays I don’t anymore 

If I have a bad day

Yes I rant here angrily but I don’t dwell on it

And btw, I know Facebook isn’t a great place to ask for advice on this stuff but I just have no where else to go, I don’t have any friends, and I have no money for a therapist. This is a last resort if some of the stuff i talk about isn’t aloud feel free to take it down!

But recently my mom and dad separated which has already been kind of hard on me. After my dad moved out my mom has seem to taken a lot of that stress out on me. Me and her fight constantly, like everyday now I’m always on edge cause every time I talk to her it just ends up in yelling. And I’m just not sure what to do. After me and her both calm down we sit down and talk about ot but there really isn’t a point cause she just repeats the same thing the next day. This has also caused some confidence issues. I’ve never been super confident due to some bullying at my old school but hearing my own mother say that I’m an annoying brat is honestly a lot more hurtful than someone else saying it, especially when she says that stuff to my own brother.

I've been on it for many....many years but it's never really worked.  Sure it takes the edge off (so to speak) but I'm still struggling with depression and anxiety. And it's really numbed my emotions, and is making it very difficult to think and has made me very apathetic. I feel stuck like I'm not getting any worse (even though I kind of am) and I'm not getting any better. For a couple of reasons I've been wanting to get off of them for a while now. In the past there's been times when I couldn't get them right away, in someways I feel better when I'm not on them. In other ways I don't. Not to mention the terrible withdrawal. I'm also worried about long term effects of being on them for to long. I don't think you are supposed to be on them for as long as I have.","Trevor, I would recommend not taking it.

And then… after calling off the engagement iand listening to him, they resumed engagement after my father convinced her to get married anyway. 

He said he did not like seeing me suffer and after seeing me post manic episode when I was 20, he quietly wished his daughter had listened to him. 

And here I am more than 35 years after that decision being told that I am an ungrateful son who doesn’t listen to his parents when they good life advice and throw my life away. 

I find the bitter irony of being lectured on the wisdom of age would conveniently forget this exchange and the knowledge that I was born against the wishes of my own grandfather…",We have created a new community of Womens Health and Wellness.

It’s so sad when you heal you notice ppl remain the same 

Same negative mindset, toxic ways and nasty attitude

I’m so close into going 0 ppl in my life and enjoying my own company and my mom’s ( I’m close to her after all and it seems I was toxic and I did a lot of healing since I got my surgery)

Also update: 

I randomly got anxious last night for no reason and yep the enemy was overthinking I looked at more photos of the haircut I want and I’ll look great 

I deserve it. 
I went through this tough time of surgery and it’s been 2 years since my hair looks awful and very faded 

So yes it will be good 

And I’ll take time off in the online world again or slowly quit 

As for discord situation I thought ya know 2 years hiatus would like improve but ppl are still nasty no matter what server its like im stuck in time

They’re nasty
Needy
And hostile 
And I’m absorbing this unnecessary energy and feeling anxiety 

NO 
Enough 
I mediated not too long ago to keep myself calm 

No thanks 

I’ll stick to my 
Games 
Drawing 
And Anime 

This time I’m done self sabotaging I’m quitting online world slowly","We'll stay away from them then, problem solved, no point lingering on with it",

Good morning folks. 14 days sober. Life is still interesting. I think I'm addicted to Minecraft and the song Sic Transit Gloria ... Glory Fades by New Band.,Well done :) 14 days is great,
"TW: self-harm

Having a hard few days. Spouse doesn’t understand my disorder (he says AA-I’m a recovering alcoholic and addict too-is the cure to mental illness) and he is aggressive. I’ve been sober for 2 1/2 years.

I’ve been in and out of therapists and hospitals and I feel worse then even. I’ve started to have thoughts of killing myself-although I wouldn’t do it because I know how it feels to be the one left and I don’t want to die. But the thoughts keep coming in-crash the car to make it look like an accident or fall asleep in the bathtub. I am a brick and I am drowning slowly.

I need a new therapist but starting over with those are so fricking hard. I’m pretty sure I’ve been misdiagnosed and have BDD II","Well done for being brave enough to reach out, wish I was. And you should be super proud for being clean for 2.5 years, that's a huge achievement. Sending you the best of luck x",
,Well I'm getting drunk but do have a cold so not happy 😡,
KNOW THAT YOU ARE CREATED TO BE VERY SPECIAL AND UNIQUE! NO ONE IS PERFECT NOR IS EVERYONE COMPLETELY HEALED. THE BEAUTY IN THAT IS STILL BEING ABLE TO LOVE YOURSELF AND MOVE FORWARD. THAT WILL BRING YOU CLOSER TO HAPPINESS! THAT’S LOVE! ❤️💪🏽,Well said,
Let's get hysterical about mental health...,Well said,
"Please take control of your life. I read many things on here and it all seems to be the same, including myself.  If I can do it with how severe my condition is, you can too. You have to push yourself every day. Every day. I don't even want to leave my house but I have kids. Fight back. When you keep your mind busy it helps so much. I hope this message reaches at least one person. You can take back control of your life. Life doesn't have to be as bad as we think or it is. You know you might have kids looking up to you, animals counting on you. Find a reason and do want you were made for. We weren't born to fit in, we were born to stand out. Love ya all.",Well said my friend...see your challenges as stepping stones in your life,
"Today's my bff/sister's funeral 😔 I am having a lot of anxiety 😖 I'm not ready to see her😵‍💫. This is very difficult for me, but I know I must go. I'm still in shock. 😳",Were you close with her. I would tell your sister of your concerns but then maybe your sister may need someone meed support.My son died two years ago in August of 2023. We didn’t have an open casket because we cremated him. I didn’t plan a big funeral but because of COVID. I didn’t want to put his ashes with by my mom until March. I wanted my other children to have a good Christmas. At the grave one of my sons read a scripture and played a song. It wasn’t easy.sending prayers for you and your family.,
"Sorry it's late or early, depending on how you look at it but I had a recent review with my doctor and he suggested taking citalopram in the evening so I have tonight and I am WAC.

,What are the best times for food fast?,
I liv alone. Find it so difficult.. I suffer from anxiety and depression. Just want to cry .. get very annoyed depressed.,What are you anxious about? Also how long you have been this way?,
Some times i hate my life bcus most days i wake up anxious and depressed which can be really annoying being stuck in bed and not having the strength to get up or do anything for that matter and the voices don't help much the mental health team them intrusive which tbh doesn't make sense i call them fkn annoying wot makes them worse is if I'm around people for to long bcus the voices will focus on those around me and I'll end up having suicidal thoughts and hallucinations the last time that happened was last march when I was put in emergency accommodation after a fire i don't want that to happen again bcus i was in a bad way for almost 6 months after moving in to my new place.,What do you do to distract yourself?,
"How do you recover from having your family being taken away ( long story) and have zero self worth and enjoy absolutely nothing about life. Continuously thinking where did it all go wrong and theres no way of going back to how things were when you were content. Asking for help left me in a position of vulnerability and caused my whole life to be turned upside down. And everytime i try to better myself i complete said accomplishment and have no interest in using the skills i learnt. I feel i am continuously going through career changes to better myself. Yet i also feel like im still trying to prove that im not a failure by doing these changes. But it will never change what U turn ive had in life and it doesnt make me feel like im getting anywhere. And the only time i do not feel this unbearable amount of strain ( anxiety sadness, upset, outbursts of anger, fear of letting anyone in emotionally,  no self worth and so on) is when i am asleep. And if thats the only time i feel content now then i feel i need to sleep forever after.

** ive been to the drs and had "" talk theory "" and its been told me to that there really is no answer to my troubles and i just need to take every day as it comes. But everyday is a mental torture of feeling lost unwanted not needed and not important, no matter how many people tell me otherwise","What I can offer is someone to chat with (me ) weather it be about stress or fun  interesting things   distractions and who knows where answers to ur questions may pop up from this.

"I've never had any straight male friends because I've spent the majority of my life being being bullied, verbally abused, and treated like garbage by most straight men. Not saying they are all the same but a lot of them have made me feel unwelcomed and unsafe. It has taken a toll on my mental health and I still have trauma from the time I was bashed for being gay, the homophobes who attacked me never never caught. I'm not trying to make any of you feel bad for being straight and I'm not trying to say you're all homophobic just saying that I haven't ever felt welcomed around straight men. I don't even have anything in common with most of them. There will always be hateful people who will try to tear me down and make me feel worthless simply because I'm gay.","Why do you NEED straight male friends specifically??

"My son is almost 23yrs old and suffers with depression. He went away to camp America for 5 months and seemed to get on well. He's been back since Oct and has been absolutely fine until Christmas day. He went out on the Saturday night stayed with friends and came home around midnight on Christmas eve. He came in a good mood, wasn't drunk but had been drinking. We know he doesn't do Christmas so didn't pressure him to come down on Christmas day but made sure he knew he was wanted to join in. We don't do much, my daughter (16) was working first thing and I had our horses to do and a 90min drive to pick my mum up. We didn't see my son until the Wednesday. He's extremely unhappy and unapproachable unless you want to be screamed at. I did manage to ask him on the Tuesday if everything was OK and if he needed to talk then to give me a shout. He's not put his invoice in at work and they are off on holiday for 2 weeks which will leave him short but despite asking him He's not bothered. If I do it for him it will cause more trouble.
Do I leave him to it or contact a Dr? He was meant to get help before but because he was a work when they finally phoned and even though he was able to talk they refused as he was at work!

"Buckle up long post. 

I’m 50 and have had the worst Christmas and New Year period of my life. 

Adding a bit of background. I’ve had my 29 year old daughter and her 2 kids living with me for almost 2 years to help her sort herself out financially. This hasn’t worked but what has happened is she’s created a toxic environment in my house with my partner who she doesn’t like. Main reason is my partner had the ‘audacity’ to not be happy at the way the kids in particular have wrecked my house. For further context my daughter pays nothing to live here. 

Anyway the atmosphere has been horrible for a while and my daughter doesn’t seem to be having any luck in finding anywhere to live. 

As a consequence of the atmosphere my partner and I chose to spend Christmas Day with her side of the family the first time I’ve never been with my kids in years. We actually had a half decent day, however we got home and my daughter was shouting in my partners face as the dog had ripped the box off one of the kids’ xmas toys. I stuck up for my partner but since Xmas night my partner won’t come downstairs as she’s not prepared to act like everything is fine. 

Despite me not arranging anything my family decided they would be celebrating NYE at my house. I sat downstairs with them not happy to be fair and me and my partner have not spoken. She’s still in bed. 

I feel like I have failed everyone. I’ve had awful feelings and pains for two days and if I wasn’t such a coward I’d probably end it all. In fairness I’ve contemplated it almost every day for the last 6 weeks. 

I’m even tempted to just go missing for a couple of days to see if anyone notices. 

Awful thing is my family are pretty much in the wrong, my partner is stubborn and I just feel like both parties are almost making me choose between the other. I’ve even had other members of the family share videos from an old Xmas where I was with an ex with the comment ‘better times’. 

I feel like I have no control over my life any more.","Wow that's a lot to unpack. 
But as an outsider, one can see where boundaries could have been drawn, and advice could have been given, or taken at certain points. 
But we're not in the 'time travel' business, so we can't go back taking the knowledge we have now. We are where we are. 
You don't need, or want, someone telling you what you should have done. You want someone to help you move forward from today. 
And let me tell you right now - going to sleep and not waking up, is NOT the answer. 

The glimmer of enjoyment you had on Christmas day, shows that you still love your partner, and you still know how to connect and relax, or at least find some normality. 
So the answer is, to find a way through this particular tricky spider's web of family emotions and physical/verbal confrontations to get back to some normality. 
Where are you based - UK or abroad?",

Also replies to all spam emails.

"Hi everyone again. I had my first psychosis today. To be completely honest its possibly one of the worst feelings or occurences someone can endure. Having experienced it firsthand, I have nothing besides respect for people who suffer psychotic episodes on a daily basis. What I had specifically is the Kandinsky-Klerambo syndrome. Which is hard to explain but basically it is a set of symptoms that involve feelings of being controlled and feeling completely out of synch with your body. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience and what helped you move on, because now after getting through that nightmare I hope that I can find ways to prevent that from happening with as many people as possible.","Yeah I have psychosis, it's not nice to have I came off medication myself don't think it was helping about 5 years ago I feel a lot better without medication I have a lot of bad days but good one as well xx",

Can mental health make you to have no interest in praying.i need help😭😭😭,"Yes! Sometimes I have to write things down. Almost like following a process instead of being spiritual, but it gets my head into the space. So, maybe lay it out something like this:
Dear God,
Thank you for everything. (Or list specific things.)
Please forgive me of my sins and hear my prayers.
I pray for:
(List out. Include your mental health and disconnection feelings.)
Amen

Or, you can just recite the Lord’s Prayer.

"Advice on what to do 

So okay I often go on big discord servers voice chats while I draw yes I love to draw for improvement and fun I nearly draw daily 

But if I wanna get focused on something I need to have something in the background rather it’s engaging with someone or music but I’m kinda getting bored of both 

But the thing is I’m very absorbent to others energy even if I ignore hard enough but so 

In context I actually have mixed feelings on discord while I was on my worst mindset and era I took 2 years break and I went back on it 

For like 2 months it was good people were weird but I did find the ones who were nice and good vibes but now it’s constant feels like bad deja vu again people constantly fight well that didn’t change but overtime it just gets ugly to listen to 

Also doubting things like my age or making fun of my voice which I can’t help both things 

I can’t help I’m 27 who doesn’t look like one or sounds like one I both look and sound young 

Idk discord is just getting lame for me again but part of me is lost on what to do while I draw

Like I listen to music often that I’m getting bored of that too 

But here’s the advice 

What do you guys usually do while focused on a hobby besides listening to music 

I want something on the background while I draw 

Idk where I’m going with this rant but it’s just eating me up so I thought I’d write it even if it doesn’t make any sense","You are not alone I can promise that! If you look around online its like there are 2 clear types of people when it comes to study or hobby, half want something, music, TV etc, and the other half, the exact opposite, like for them, the white noise is in the silence, so the hobby becomes almost meditative, which is sounds like what you are seeking. Have you tried...nothing 🙂 
I will also add, creating my own Discord server and inviting likeminded people that I liked listening to was a gamechanger for me, as admin, if I don't like someone, or their energy, BANNED 🙂 
Hope this maybe helps.",

"Hey guys!
I’m 25 and I think I have cardiophobia. I have no idea why, but ever since I was like 15/16 years old, my biggest fear has been having a heart attack. 

Tonight, I couldn’t sleep and my mind likes to fuck with me and went “lol our heart only beats when we’re thinking about it”. Like I know it’s not like that but my anxiety went “message sent to brain lol” Like you know when you switch to manual breathing because you’re thinking about it? I don’t know why my brain went “lol maybe we have manual heart beats too”. And now I’m laying awake like “ohhhh man unless I think about it, my heart ain’t beating”. 

I was thinking of some triggers, maybe these caused it?

1. My brother yeeted to Jesus when I was 14. He d———- in the Susquehanna river trying to save a friend. 

2. I got Hep C from a piercing at the mall (cough cough Piercing Pagoda cough). I cleared it without any medical intervention and nearly unsubscribed from life because my doctors thought it was anxiety or I was faking. I went from 130 pounds to 110 pounds in like a month.

3. In high school health class, we watched a video of someone having a heart attack. I was feeling lightheaded, like I was about to pass out. Another kid beat me to it, and I remember snapping back like “oh shit, mfs dropping like flies in here, this is dangerous, I need to get tf out of this classroom.”

Thoughts? What do I do about it?","You've answered your own question with the explanation of whst went on... it's uour mind and thought process that's doing it, if you somehow didn't think like thst then it wouldn't happen.

"I feel like crawling under a rock and not getting out. 
I am currently 27 weeks pregnant, I have been extremely unwell with hyperemesis and have been in and out of hospital since i was 7 weeks. I am usually a full time working manager in hospitality and run around like crazy which I obviously can't do anymore. I've had to cut down on my hours and what things I can do at work, but because I'm now part time, someone else is taking the reins on my responsibilities (which they do NOT need to do as I've been trying to come back) I've been pushed aside. I feel useless. I'm so so unwealthy, I have no money. Everytime I try and push for more hours, I am the first one to be sent home, I tell them I need to stay, im well enough to stay and I want to work, they say no you need to go home we don't need you today. My partner has had to pay his bills and half of my half for thr bills, buy all of the stuff to be ready for when the baby comes and support himself. I feel useless and worthless. If I can't support myself now how am I supposed to support and look after a baby?! I feel like the baby and my partner deserve so much better than me and would both be better off without. My depression has hit hard and now I'm scared thst it'll be worse after I've had the baby. I'm at a complete loss and I'm hopeless.
Sorry for the lobg post I just needed to get this off my chest 😪","Your emotional firstly hormonal so things may feel a little more intensified. You going to have to accept it. You do have to work less and prioritise you health. Your not worthless your being a good mum. Your partner is doing what he should supporting you in your pregnancy.

"Hi i am struggling at the moment, Especially at work, it a new job been training and had a really tough shift, all my negative thoughts have started again, you cannot do it, your thick , your useless, i want it to work, i want to do well, why does my head do this, cannot sleep, feel so isolated, didnt help watching eastenders, i am a single parent with a son who 15 with special need, now i cannot stop thinking what will happen to him if i go. My head just will not shut up, i am so tired. My next shift is friday and i know it going to be worse than today. Sick of crying, when i am at work i panic, think i am doing everything wrong got to the point my manager said you say sorry one more time.my  self esteem is shattered, my confidence is broken i just dont know what to do, i got this job  to get out the house because of my mental health but i just think it making it worse. The guys i work with are amazing, but i feel me being so emotional/ moody  is going to against me and i am not going to pass my probation. I just dont know what to do for the best. I really dont want to go on the sick. As i just be sat at home on my own while my son sits in his room 24/7 i dont have anyone that i can talk to as i feel i done this to myself as i moved away from friends and family. Everyone said you feel isolated and they where worried but i just had to have a fresh start. I talk to my neighbours every now and then. But its not the same i dont know what else i can do to make myself happy. My other half works 24/7 and has hes own issues. Sorry its a long one but needed to vent and get it off my chest, i rang my daughter she was amazing but she got a new born baby and she should not be helping me with my mental health. Any advice very welcome cos i really dont know what to do for the best. I have no hobbies or  interests apart from tv and cycling even thou it in the low 20s i am burning like a log on a fire within a hour. So unless i go really early or really late cannot go on a bike ride. Just want to scream. I starting my meds again today  so hopefully this will help. I was coping without them for a while but now i feel like i need them again hate needing 2 tablets to make myself feel better why can't i do it myself. it 2am so going to try and do this sleep thing. Fingers crossed but normally when i feel like this cannot sleep til around 7am when my son gets up so feel like i am negotiating him Sorry its so long.",Your not alone in these feelings and rant away whwn you need to that's what it's all about inknow how isolation can feel ileft my entire life behind when I left London in 2008 to live hear in cambs no friends haven't my job now in  wheel chair have twin boys who I'm going through problems to sort out with there mum nd her partner they refuse to go back and want to sty hear but don't want to upset there mum which I understand and I'm stuck in middle that's the short version the feelings you have had iv had them to many times.

"‘Behind the facade of that smile’....

🖤 I have had great people message me of late. Some have opened up about their own Mental Health, the causes and their pains. 

The one thing I take away from these contacts is that they reached out. They spoke to me about something that is considered taboo, personal and scary....but they spoke and I listened, which means the message is getting out there. 

Its ok to not be ok, open up and speak to someone. It doesn't lessen you, nor does it harm you. It will make you stronger and those around you understand you. I promise you.

"I am trying to significantly lower the rate of suicide. Because yes I tried it. And I was sitting one day, looking for a therapist and I had an idea.

A littl background, I have Anxiety, Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Attacks, and Agoraphobia. These things make it hard to leave my house some days. 

Fining a therapist is hard too. What if you don’t feel comfortable and start to have a panic attack? So I came up with an idea.

I want to have something like a “mixer” once a month. Doctors, therapists and psychiatrists would ll wear one color wristband. The patients would wear another color so it’s est to spot. 

And because sometimes it can really be hard to leave the house alone, you can bring a friend who will wear white wrist bands.

This way you can get to know a potential doctor and, bear with me, feel the vibes in the room. If you find someone you feel comfortable with then make an appointment right there.

It’s just an idea but as someone suffering from mental illness myself, it makes sense. 

Please respond so I know if I’m going the right way or not. Thank You!!We are excited to announce the launch of our new project! #newproject",,

"Delete if not allowed... I don't have anyone to talk to but I want to talk to my Dr about my mental health but I'm afraid I'll just look like an addict. About 10 years or so ago I mentioned to my Dr that I felt depressed. Started meds. My grandma had just died. Shortly after I took an IOP course and they suggested I showed signs of borderline personality disorder. From that suggestion I spiraled down web MD and thought I must be bipolar. Mentioned it to my Dr and started meds. At some point before the bipolar I did mention ADHD and my Dr prescribed me meds. But then I had to switch Drs because of insurance issues and they refused to prescribe it because I was also self medicating with Mary j which I literally started using after my grandma's funeral. That night. So I was taken off the ADHD meds. But I still wanted to manage my symptoms which is why I looked into bipolar and mentioned that. And started those meds. But About 3 years ago I was still struggling and decided to give ADHD medication another try but was unable to get a prescription because now I'm diagnosed as bipolar. So without a prescription I obtained what I needed anyway. And it worked. I started using a low dose daily for the past 3 years. I was able to go back to trade school and get a license in Cosmo. Get off probation from trouble I got into due to untreated adhd.. risky activities and such.. and I've been a lot better in many other areas that relate to ADHD. Nicer. More patient. More understanding. Better listener. Etc. But About a month ago there was a shortage on meds and I was unable to find them so I tried something I said I never would. And that's when I really started looking into ADHD. In 2nd grade my teacher mentioned it to my mom but she refused to hear it and brushed it off. I've struggled with self image, feeling good enough, feeling like I fit in, being able to communicate appropriately, focus, self medicating, poor spending habits, poor decision making, overeating, etc. And I began to notice that all the symptoms I thought were bipolar were actually ADHD. The articles even state that these symptoms are commonly misdiagnosed as ADHD. I'm realizing now that any time I have struggled with addiction. It's been to manage symptoms of ADHD. I really want to talk to my Dr about the possibility that I was misdiagnosed as bipolar depressed. And instead I'm ADHD and would like to try stimulants regularly because I truly believe they help. I even take better care of my hygiene when using things you're not supposed to instead of letting it go like addicts usually do. I struggle with labeling myself as an addict because I've never ruined my life or been on anything to the point where anyone was aware of it. I haven't stolen for it even though I have stolen just to feel good at something. A symptom of adhd. I havent sold my stuff for it. Etc. But I know that doesn't mean I'm not an addict. How do I tell my Dr that I'd like to stop taking my current medications that are just treating symptoms of my ADHD and start taking a medication that will treat my ADHD as a whole without sounding like I just wanna get controlled substances. Honestly when I do things I'm not supposed to I'm constantly wishing it could be done the correct way through a Dr instead of the way I have been ""forced"" to do it. And when I do use I only use enough for energy and focus you're supposed to get from your ADHD meds and not so much I can't breathe or stop eating sleeping and taking care of my hygiene etc. I don't like feeling more than I'm supposed to. So I'm not constantly chasing a larger feeling. Also I can sleep regular. In fact better on regular stimulant use. And I'm obese so I need the appetite suppressant. My weight Dr says I should only eat once a day. But I'm constantly mining for dopamine through food and soda, vaping etc. I took 80+ screenshots of ADHD symptoms that I relate to. Some are repetitive but describe it differently which is what I liked. I want to write down the research and how it relates to me and a specific memory from my past that represents it... But it's so hard for me to organize my thoughts 😭 because I'm doing this alone without the help of a Dr and I'm not a Dr. Ofc idk what I'm doing. All I know is I want to be a normal healthy functioning adult. I'm sick of my mental health controlling my life. I want to control my mental health! What should I do? Should I mention how I've been coping and how it helps some but not as much as it would if it were through a Dr. Or do I just talk about the research and the memories from my childhood and present that relate?",,

I’m also committed to my drawings often which is new to me cause the sick pattern id get was get too much into my head
Lose motivation then barely draw 

Or do hobbies in general 

Also I notice people ( real life none of you angels you guys are great to me 💙) who tries to stop me from who I am cause I can have some anger issues or be too expressive not ever gonna work 

I suppressed those too much in my teen years I’m slowly getting anger under control but the rest nope you either ride or d!& with me cause it’s part of who I am and I’m so content with myself 

I am free this way baby and is free who I am

I shall be dramatic as I want 
I shall be expressive as I want

"What are signs of food addiction cuz I’ve been thinking I have it? My therapist says I don’t have it when I believe I do. I can’t control myself whenever eating junk food like Lay’s chips, Cheetos, ruffles chips,  shrimp chips, or any other snacks that are so good (as tasty as Cheetos, Doritos, shrimp chips, etc. lol)

The last ttime I ate the shrimp chips from Costco, I couldn’t control myself and kept eating it.  I’m not sure if I do that to cope with my negative feelings and to release dopamine

Lol it’s like I get out of jail and eat so much junk food that I find addicted to",,

"Mental health can mean many different things to different people, but many agree that good mental health results in,
• feeling able to cope with most things that can happen in life
• experiencing a range of emotions, including joy
• getting quality sleep and feeling rested on waking
• interacting well with others
Even those with excellent mental health don’t achieve all of these all the time!
There are many ways in which we can boost to our mental health and wellbeing, from taking a walk in nature to clinical therapies.
Yoga is an accessible activity that can help to boost our mental health. Evidence for this has been found in a growing number of scientific studies looking at the effects of yoga on wellbeing.

These sessions may be helpful if you are experiencing feelings of stress or anxiety, low mood, poor quality sleep, fatigue or overwhelm.

"Hi all, I am working with a colleague to develop a product that can revolutionize the way young people work through recovery on their mental health journey.  I have been diagnosed and medicated for anxiety for nearly 20 years and have worked with young people with mental health needs throughout my career as a teacher, as a Special Educational Needs Coordinator and as a mental health trainer.  With this experience, I recognise the importance of young people owning their own story and feeling empowered to have goals and work with their mental health professionals and/or the support around them to move forward.  We are committed to developing this with young people so co-production will be at the heart of our work and this is the first step.  We would love to hear from young people aged 13 to 25 who are working with a mental health professional or who worked with a mental health professional during this age.

OHHH THIS ONE GOES HARD and it’s so true!!!!,,
"Thats right be authentic be you 
Be so much your own self even if its weird that shockks people as other feels your energy as this Brazilian song by this rock singer Pitty Says ill translate in portuguese to English “the important thing is being even if its strange BE YOU even if it is Bizarre bizarre bizarre” 

Even if it feels strange fake till you make it then it will become real and your brain will accustom to it 💙

Do your healings 
Do your most important thing which is shadow work 
Cry whenever you neeeded Even if you cry often 

Crying is importantnt i reallyze so much now 
I’m a crybaby for a reason 
But my type of crybaby Is the one who cries and doesnt dwell on it and releases whatever I’m being held back 

Remember your emotions are visitors dont prolong their stay 

Give them 10 minutes then kick them out like an evil tenant

Drink water 
Mediate 

Own a singing bowl if you can I cant explain but your brain  will thank it the sound is so calming 

Exercise most important 
Sing 
Dance 

MOST IMPORTANT LIMIT SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE 

I only use social media nowadays to post my art, to talk to people barely and for video memes 

I do all and im finally in bliss 💙🧿",,

"THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME 🖤

You can too… TALK to your mates, your loved ones on how you feel.

+MH🖤⚒

Sunday was the final of the African Cup of Nations - host Nation Ivory Coast 🇨🇮 beat Nigeria 🇳🇬 in a tense final.

With a few minutes left in the game - the winning goal was scored by Sebastian Haller ⚒ who in July 2022, was diagnosed with testicular cancer…

Haller came out and spoke of the challenges he faced over the past couple of years but never ever did he “give up “ although he had fears of never playing again 

What a truly inspiring story! 

This week let’s not let our failures define us but let’s push on and aim to achieve greatness in everything we do

So a gd few years ago now i started getting this pain in the back of my head. I had to go to an eye doctor for an x-ray of the eye apparently there is something wrong with who my eyes water and i needed a procedure done where they use a very small lazer to make a really small hole in the bottom of my eye but i didn't have it done because I was to scared to have it done now the pain is bk has been for the past few days but thankfully the pain doesn't last long then it's gone again if it keeps up I'll be going to my doctor to find out if there is something actually wrong with my eye or something else I'm hoping it's not a tumour.,,

Hello guys I am schizoaffective and the episodes have started again,,
"In the dark 
You find a light
To guide your way 
Through the night 

On a hot summer day 
With a gentle breeze 
That calms your mind 
Makes you feel at ease 

Warm summers day 
To chase the cold away
Help your mind 
To relax and stray 

What is left to do
And what is left to say
You are 
That light, that breeze that day

Sometimes meds or weed don't help but you can't tell nobody.you just pray your mind slows down. Bi polar 💕,,
I'm not liking the side effects of my new meds i can tell they have really messed up my eyesight plus I'm constantly fighting to stay awake which doesn't help matters one bit the fighting to stay awake part i can handle with no problems because when I'm tired my eyes don't really play up but the meds I'm on omg but saying that I'm not sure if I was this way when I first started quetiapin 🤔,,
"I've read that many mental health issues come from having to deal by yourself with a lot of issues when you were a child. But what if that was your brain predisposition??? As far as I can remember, I had the need to do it all by myself, not asking for help, needed to take care of everyone....",,
So I got my meds this but was only given 6 tablets i have to go in tomorrow or Tuesday for the rest I've been put on Venladex XL 75mg's to be taken in the morning i took them at 10.30am when I got in at first it didn't do anything but over time I'm now having problems with my eyesight as they feel like i don't have my glasses on but I do i wasn't expecting them to work so fast.,,

Is it just me or does anyone else feel a great sense of relief in a Saturday evening into Sunday night before feeling anxious again when Monday arrives?,,
I pick up my antidepressants in the morning i just hope they work 🤔,,
"I have issues being vulnerable because it's devastating when it's used against me but I am trying to improve myself. I have an issue with not feeling sorry when I hurt certain people. It's not all people. There are people that I walk on eggshells to not hurt and then there's people who I just can't put myself in their shoes. One of those people is my husband. He hurt me intensely with his alcoholism just over a year ago. It wasn't just the drinking, it was the behaviors  that came along with it. I think I got so numb from taking what he would throw at me, metaphorically speaking, but then it crossed into me saying things to hurt him back because for once, I just wanted him to feel what he was doing to me. I got so desperate that I sank that low and I'm not proud of it. Now, he's over a year sober but I have the hardest time empathizing with him. He could be pouring out his heart and I just don't feel it. It's not that I don't feel anything at all for him, it's not that I don't feel bad for the things that I say to him in response to the hurtful things he says to me and a lot of times I don't feel like he's being genuine with his feelings, I feel like sometimes he says/acts a way to be manipulative but I don't actually know. How do you get empathy for someone to come back?",,
"I have BPD and seem to struggle to hold down jobs, due to meltdowns, anxiety and splitting on other staff. I do really want to work and have always been a hard grafter is this a common thing for someone with BPD to experience?",,

Is anyone available to talk I'm not in a good place right now?,,
I like this site because I have issues sometimes I can't control them at all,,
I hope my appointment goes well with pip on the 14th reason why I say that is because I'm too polite and I know what they're like like the last time which was bk in 2018 they put on the report that I was well spoken and that's one of the reasons they gave me a zero which is ridiculous tbh how am I meant to act just because i have mental health issues doesn't mean I'm going to act like a dick because I don't I'm honest and to the point i don't know how to be mean it's just not me.,,
"Just wondering what people’s experience has been with Geodon and the side effect of it making you tired.  I am currently taking Lamictal and have added Geodon before and stopped due to sleepiness.

"I'm struggling a bit. When they say you can be in the same room and be poles apart they arnt wrong. I have been with my partner 21yrs and are supposed to be getting married this year. He has been ill for a long time and it's taken its toll heavily. Each day we wake up go through the motions then go to bed. Our lives are pretty much eat sleap repeat. Each day the same where he's in to much pain to even help with anything. He apologies and even sais I've not been much use to you. When he said it tonight, I even said under my breath when are you much use to me. He'll even apologise for not really being with it. I cannot remember the last time we were intimate. Yes we love each other but I feel so alone and feel I really can't carry on. I'm at the point where I just want to walk away from my life and start a fresh some where else with a completely new identity. I know in one way I'm being selfish but I don't know what else to do",,
"Hi there folks, I'm new here. I'm finding it hard to find moments of being sociable at the moment. I've had a full on breakdown. Im the confused, worried pregnant woman I was, with the emotions of fatherly let down and hurt. Dealing with the motherly hurt and spite I encountered. Im feeling the sexual abuse and fear and aloneness. With domestic violence, emotional abuse and fear for my kids. Mourning the loss of my physical abilities and whackiness due to my illness while being tested for additional health complications all rolled into one big mess. That's me right now. Everything has bit back at once. I haven't spoken to my buddy, my daughter for some time. I've ripped the feck out of my husband. I've threatened my own life, absolutely with 💯 intention as I pulled the biggest knife out of the block and screamed at my husband to just finish me. Although, I have been very honest with my friends some are still wondering why I'm not there to support them. One is  insisting that if they come to stay with me for a week with their husband they can get me out and about for fun and lift my mood. This cuts so much deeper than a touch of depression. Why don't people understand?",,
I got a text from pip at 8.40am letting me know that I have a phone appointment with them at 9am on the 14th of February which is great but terrifying at the same time because i could lose my pip but at least I don't have to go there because I'd end up being a right mess.,,
Wish I had people to talk to like that is close to me not far away it's horrible being on your own no family being home alone as I have been for years every night go out my mind I don't have a voice to talk to just always on edge stressed and most of the time not relaxed cause being alone for so many years drives you mad it's very very hard to cope and I've not coped well over the years people might say but you have coped and managed but I haven't it's been absolute hell nobody reading this most likley won understand my feelings I feel so unwell with my wellbeing and mental health that have been so alone many years don't have anyone to lean on never have all my life no love support never get any help with my mental health all these years I tried going to the doctors so many times and that isn't a option no more cause they never have I just want to be surrounded by others who suffer with mental health don't want to be on my own through it all but I always do in the end abandoned no one stays always get left behind I'm sick of it to mentaly and physically if my brain had a stomach it would be sick aswell just far from coping these days and the dark weather doesn't help why must I have to never have any support and love I'm 30 next year and never had anyone by my side in life I'm ranting now yes and saying about how I feel how am I meant to grow when no ones there for me and no ones helping me through all my dark days I have a strange feeling of feeling sick like it's been so many years suffering alone feeling sick with my mental health some people are lucky they will always have someone family I don't or a special friends some people are lucky to have lots of people there for them but I never have only online I'm sick of being alone in life going out of my mind every night,,

I'm posting anonymous as this is hard to deal with, let alone having people know. please bear with the post it is going to be a longish one.

So i always had my suspicions i was S/A as a child but have no recollection of the abuse happening, just posistions etc i use to put my barbies in.
Well i obtained a brief copy of my medical records and there is was in black and white 1989 S/A, emotional and physical abuse i was 2yrs old!

I was in an abusive relationship that lasted almost 10 years, it started off slow nothing minor but over time it got bigger at first my second ex gf got jealous of my daughter and I don't know why because my gf never told me even when I asked she just said i don't know, my gf got it into her head that I was going to leave her for my own daughter ( 😡 ) making me out to be a pedo 😡 but I didn't know about that until after we split, anyone younger than me i wasn't allowed to talk to including my own daughter anyone older than me i was allowed to talk to 😡 i wasn't allowed to do anything say like clean cook i wasn't allowed to buy anything for myself she had to do it all 😡 if I tried to do things around the house she would hit me 😡 the worst thing she did to me was bk in 2008 when she kicked the shit out of me in the town where we live in front of people who thought it was funny this was on my 40th birthday 😡 im keeping it short because it's to painful to talk about in 2016 she made me homeless which was the best thing she ever did for me but unfortunately I now suffer from mental health issues when I go into town im terrified that im going to see her because we live in the same town tho she lives about 5 miles from me.",,

Does anyone else get this? If so I need some advice.

"Even someone whos in tune with thejr emotjons has their days since monday ive been feeling so off so angry so hystefical so impulsive so erratic 

I cant tell if its my hormones acting up due to late period or 
Hormones combined with overly use of social media 

Im pretty sure its both ive been mentally disturbed lately and around my birthday too( 27th of this month) which is insane so i must do a social detox only watch youtube and tik tok for memes 

Maan i love my memes 

Once im more calmer cuz i got so anxious just now freaking out about my birthday cake ordering not working out that i began to have impulsive thoughts how there isnt gonna be any party or nothing which 90% i lived so much in my head snd i know once i do that again is that im disturbed hy something talking to people well even if its not in person i catch their energy and it gets drained 

So yeah im very disoriented for now so once again ill barely be on and cut off discord idk hbu but too much of the same thing for me is energy drainig 

Once im more calm ill meditate snd all if i do now i wont calm down i tried before

First I had found a new job and was actually excited the first two weeks I started I got pulled over twice for literally nothing then my husband got really sick and was in the hospital for over a week and I had to stay home take care of my children who as well as me got pretty sick ourselves, oh and we had moved and we went through brutal temps with no heat or water for a week because of water heater, and then after verbal agreement with my new job before I started they decided to tell me two weeks before school started that I'd have to work days when they knew that that was not possible for me to do so I got pushed to quit.
Long story short now I am broke my car needs to be inspected but can't because check engine light for a stupid small O2 leak I've been pulled over 3 times for that and after four days finally just got our water working again because of the freezing weather.  Didn't mean to go on and on and I can mention more but I wont it's just the truth of the matter that no matter how hard I try I can't catch a break and it's saddens me that I do know so many others going through  things that we have no control over but I don't know about anyone else but I feel like I'm cursed or something!

There's someone I wish to enjoy who before I knew him better ww enjoyed eachothers company he gives acceptance and likes to chat and likes my spouse and I 

However for some reasons I can't keep contact with him 
Never had him on here he's deslexic btw  and I have to still see him twice a week at the things I know him from 
Talk about awkward and even if telling him I can't associate with him goes well today and it may be near the start of things I worry well it stay that way. It's harder because I  still have to be around him 

I guess I still have some care for him so hi hru doesn't seem necessarly fakebut I feel kinda it's pointless and we'd both know it since I don't want further dialogue. Also mild worry intentional or not that he may gossip may also share where  I live which ironically is right next to the place and near where he lives by 10 mins or 15

Has anyone here have the same problem or trouble as me about next door neighbours when they constantly banging and bumping all the time and throwing tennis balls or any board against the wall constantly all the time and their mothers don’t do anything about it when they should. Because I cannot take this anymore and I get stressed and my anxiety is not good anymore and I cannot find any way to report these bad neighbours that I do not like even though I want them moved out or evicted from the house and all I want is my five years back and I cannot get any peace and quiet anymore and I do not feel safe where I am now￼￼￼￼,,

I want to become a better version of me. For myself and for the world.

I hope you can help me.",,
"I have been struggling to go to school for awhile now and can’t make if for a full week, I need to have a day or two off every week and it’s really draining me, the lack of sleep, motivation, the stress of exams coming up and expectations some people in my family have for me, I feel particularly upset that my parents try and do so much for me and I still don’t go in, I love my mom but I can see she’s tired and disappointed of my constant absences, my dad works very hard and always at work making money for the family and I feel like I constantly let them both down with my poor mental health, they don’t feel a need to ask me if everything’s ok at school everything’s just „you’re lazy” „you don’t respect us”, I suspect I have some form of adhd but that cannot be confirmed because the test is too expensive, school is really draining me and I’m becoming a zombie, I do the same thing everyday, wake-up tired, cry, go to school and have a shit day, come home and play games, do homework and lay in my bed until 4am it doesn’t help with the fact I have no friends in school which sucks because I joined a new school after previously being bullied in the first one,in the new school the whole class already knew eachother from the year before, I’m usually excluded, eat my lunch in the bathrooms because my one friend also has shit attendance and I just end up texting my mom stuff because she is my only friend

My question is if anyone knows the reason I absolutely hate going to school and why I can’t get out of my lazy routine of doing everything the same everyday

Has anyone had similar experiences with their family and how did you get through it /talk to them about it",,

"I have been so perplexed lately. A long time missing young man was found mentally sick in the far North Nigeria, while his mum is in the South. He was in school doing a diploma, and that was the last they heard of him, until last week, that is, after a decade.  That is to say the young man has been roaming for over 10 years. He was concluded dead when nothing was heard after many years. 
The father is late, and the mum is just managing life. If anyone knows any association that can help this sick guy get well and get united to his mother, pls show compassion.

"## **FEW Natural Remedies for Anxiety**
* **Be Physically Active**
Regular exercise benefits not only your physical health, but also your mental health. A physically active lifestyle can lower the risk of developing anxiety disorders by about 60%.
* **Take Balanced Diet**
Maintaining a well-rounded diet could significantly reduce anxiety symptoms. Consuming foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and vitamins B and D can help reduce anxiety symptoms.
* **Reduce your Caffeine and Alcohol intake**
Caffeine is well-known as an anxiety inducer. Similarly, while alcohol may initially seem to relax you, it can actually increase feelings of anxiety as it wears off.
* **Make getting a good night’s sleep a top priority**
While nearly a third of adults get less than 6 hours of sleep a night, the CDC recommends that adults get 7 or more hours of sleep each day to reduce anxiety symptoms. Making getting a good night’s sleep a top priority can help reduce anxiety symptoms, even in the short term.",,

So for context our family is  broken specially around the holidays , her main reason for calling was forcing to invite us to spend time with her and her husband 

Now we dont get along with her husband due to a personal thint 

So she kept on yelling and yelling going in circles and talking about issues and being agressive for nearly two hours

Most likely I’ll draw something creepy or aggressive to rant this more 

I meditated before bed cause i got scared to have nightmares which worked prevented the nigtmares because while asleep  subconscious goes insane and often( which not lately thankgoodness) according to events i withess i have terrfying nightmares 

But as i woke up i was so sad and angry and all

My partner and I are in a long distance relationship, circumstances at the moment won’t allow is to be together, my partner and are are both currently suffering with mental health issues with our own individual issues, my partner and I used to talk about anything and everything everyday and always talked at night before bed but past 3 weeks their situation had impacted a lot, I have been there as much as I ever have been but its come a point today where they don’t want to talk at all, they’ve sat in a car park crying, when they eventually did ask me to call I had only been on the phone about 2 minutes if that and I was told I was being horrible(my words) can’t remember what they actually said, but I think we’re at break point but more worrying I think personally they’re at break if point, my only concern now is them being happy, I don’t care about our relationship as much as their happiness, what can I do to help, how do I approach this? 

I think the issue is a mix of thyroid issues(removed), menopause(currently on HRT) and depression(maybe)

On top of all that I've had addiction issues to deal and cope with. I am still standing but barley. The human body and mind can deal and cope with a lot. I don't think we were designed to cope with the modern world when we were made but through evolution we adapt. Keep strong people and keep fighting.

"TW self harm, suicidal thoughts.

Please tell me if this isn't the right group for this kind of post. 

Hello everyone, I'm not very good at words so apologies if this is a bit rambly.

I'll start with a couple of facts; I've been out of work for 6 months, all of my overdrafts are maxed out, I am so unbelievably anxious and just shit at talking to other humans and I have just recently started a new job that I hate but I know I have to do it for the money.

I have absolutely 0 confidence and since the lock down I feel like I have completely lost my old self. I have gotten worse at pretty much every aspect of socialising (I was never that good in the first place) and my depression has only gotten worse.

I'm at the point now that I will sit in my car and self harm on my breaks at this new job because it's the only way I can chill out enough to go back in instead of just driving home and quitting. I think about suicide all day. I feel trapped and helpless and I just don't know what to do.

Now the second part, my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years. I love her so much and she's definitely the best thing that ever happened to me. She is beautiful, funny, smart and confident. She has always tried to help me with my confidence and is always telling me I need to stand up for myself.

Recently when she says things that I disagree with I have tried to stand up for myself and tell her but every time she gets defensive and we don't argue but she absolutely won't back down to the point that I just give up and let her 'win'. 

I am really bad for forgetting details of things that upset me, I just remember that we had this 'thing' and how it made me feel but not any of the details of what was said (literally minutes after it happens it's like my brain wipes it). I know that this will make it really hard to tell her about how I'm feeling because she'll ask what it is she says that upsets me and I won't be able to tell her.

I have a really shit relationship with my parents and I can barely get through an evening with my 2 closest (and only) friends because I'm so horrifically awkward let alone talk to them about something like this but it's really starting to upset me.

I'm just not enjoying any aspect of life right now. I hate going to work and I don't really want to come home either (my girlfriend and I live together at my parents house). I just have no idea what I should do. I did absolutely shit at school so my job options are very limited and this one was the only one out of literally hundreds of applications that replied to me. I feel so stuck and thinking about the future just makes my skin crawl because in my head I KNOW I'm going to end up killing myself, I just come back to that every time. I have never gone through with a plan but there have been a few close calls now. 

My girlfriend knows about my depression and suicidal thoughts and she does try to help, in fact she's one of the only people that can help.

I know I'm supposed to be asking a question instead of just ranting so I'll leave it at this, does anyone have any ideas about I should do about a) work and b) standing up to my girlfriend?

I know I can't really do the situation justice in a Facebook post but just typing it out has helped me relax a bit so I really appreciate any help you can give me. Sorry for the rant.",,
"this might be a little long so apologies in advance.  first, thanks for letting me join. i've been thinking about joining one of these for a while. would like others to talk to once in a while due to problems. I thought about going into therapy, just never know a good therapist where i live and in the past (and through others) never see them all that much helpful. sometimes the best help is just someone (like a friend) that's truly willing to listen to problems. I'm married, but my wife don't seem to care about my thoughts much or she has no input anyway. I don't know. 

anyway, I'm 43 and I'm introverted. always have been introverted. in the past, i'd be very lonely and depressed due to it. never been the sociable type or some social butterfly. these days I've gotten used to it, and due to some issues with people I just assume most people keep their distance. if I didn't have to work, i'd stay home all day possibly if i could and do things around the house and probably be a bit happier.  I don't go to parties or to clubs/bars, in fact when I do I just get bored. I don't have much hobbies anymore because i spend too much time working because I got bills like everyone else, but I always dreamed to work in media creation and that's what my degrees are in (i have my associates in digital media and my bachelor's in interactive media design) however I'm not the greatest designer, and when I tried to sell myself in this field I never gained much interest. in fact, when I would be unemployed I would always struggle finding work when I would hear about others getting work instantly. that's why when i find a job I keep it long as possible. and I wouldn't say i do bad at job interviews. probably perhaps it's my social awkwardness that causes my struggles. 

I do not know if I have any disabilities of any kind. I don't recall ever being diagnosed, but mom has told me when i was younger that I do have a learning disability. I don't know what it would be though. younger, i thought i was stupid though but older I feel like I can figure out just about anything. I work with the intellectually disabled, and it's a pain dealing with who i work with because the guy has a diagnosed disability and lots of times calls himself stupid and claims he don't have a brain like me. I try explaining to him that if he's stupid than so am i and i'm not stupid and he can figure things out if he wants. this guy can back up a vehicle with a trailer when i can't even do that. so he's not stupid but it's trying to get him to understand he can learn like anyone else.  I could possibly be autistic, but I don't know. I never been diagnosed but see some symptoms of it. I don't even know my IQ level, but have been curious for several years but don't know where to properly find out these things when I don't have a proper therapist.  it's just hard to talk about such things because people that should listen don't want to.

my hobbies include: designing things and making videos/taking pictures (when I got time), reading, watching tv, and trying to understand the world (I tend to question everything I see and hear and things people try to tell me - i'm known to get into heated discussions if I disagree with something). I do believe in God, but i see no evidence for ghosts as one example.

thanks for reading, and looking forward to talking to some of you.",,

"Vent to this whole deal update last part:

Today was a calm day I’m slowly going back to myself but due to my emotions being shaken up for the last two days my healing eye surgery began to act up a bit my eyes leaked frequently today also from crying for two days now out of stress my eye is super dry and slowly returning to normal but 

I know I shouldn’t but my gut told me to activate my account once more to see how every member reacted there was one left from the whole drama 

Apperantly she couldn’t keep this matter on the low and had to post a status out to others calling me insane telling that no such thing was happening it was all in my head that I’m in a bad mental headspace 

I’m in a fed up being take advantage of  and done with people headspace  

She could not or the many members could not take accountability for their actions of 

Making fun how I’m into cute things 
Forcing me to play game franchise 
Often questioning me why I take breaks 
Whenever there was a topic and I stated my opinion I’d get told I’m wrong 

Disagreeing on stuff often 

No like I can’t stand being on eggshells constantly I had to ditch 

I’m maturing in areas where I feel the people around me was frozen in time frozen in a place that no longer serves me ngl 5 years ago( when I joined) I was a person who I’m not AT ALL today 

People change 
People move on 
It makes me wonder why can’t everyone get this 

So after reading this whole ordeal status I felt so much better leaving more than I’m feeling already 

It’s interesting unlike other times I’d mourn and miss a person for about a month it only took two days and I’m 90% over them 

In a way I was hating them already so ye cutting them off was so good I’m no longer carrying this burden 

But however from bad experiences when people mess me up I often remember a tad bit of good times even if it was maybe fake 

However we must all move on in order to reach our higher selves",,

"I thought I’d already hit all breaking points but tonight did it. I came in my bedroom to find my $2k plastic jaw splint (looks like a retainer) chewed up by my youngest dog.

My boyfriend and I have been struggling as it is financially, paycheck to paycheck since our mortgage alone is $2300. 
It was like 6 months ago I started seeing a dr for TMJ and when my splint was made, which I’ve been told to wear all the time…it’s been very difficult for me to do and I end up taking it out during the night when I sleep and forgot to put it back in the case this morning. Only reason my dog got to it was because I locked him in the room for just a few minutes while furniture (ripped up couch also by same dog) was being moved outside my house! It was so preventable 😭 I’m also 9 wks pregnant so more irritable and forgetful, and why any further procedure done on my jaw needs put on hold anyway (Botox was the next step before fixing my disc), so idk if there’s any point in paying to get a new one right now.

"In the midst of overwhelming loneliness, I can't help but feel the stark sting of hypocrisy. We're bombarded by endless social media posts about ""mental health awareness."" But when it comes down to it, the silence is deafening. It's like a facade of support is painted on social media platforms while in reality, the outreach for help is met with a cold, indifference.

I've sent messages to over 50 people, hoping for just one person to acknowledge me, to be that beacon of light in this darkness. Instead, I've been blocked, mocked, ignored, or met with ridicule. I've been called a freak, a weirdo, a r*****. 

I battle against self-hatred, feeling utterly unimportant, and wrestling with the reality of having no one to turn to.I hate myself for the vulnerability I'm burdened with, feeling like an inconvenience, feeling small and inconsequential in a world that seems to have no room for me.

The agony of being left alone with these thoughts is unbearable. Feeling like an insignificant figure in a crowded room, yearning for just a sliver of acknowledgment.

For those who, like me, have been let down, who have been ignored,  know that your pain is valid. Our battles are real, and it's okay to feel like this.",,

"I dream of disappearing and starting over.  What good will that do me with my mind still screwed up?   Slowly working towards something better but  It's got to be mind and body first.

Escape (therapy poem)

Running again.  Doesn't matter where I go. 
Hoping some new place will heal my soul.

My broken heart here can no longer abide 
Miles build walls, locking emotions inside 

But as hard as I try I cant escape and just be
Even running away I must still take me.

"Can I just make a Suggestion, yesterday I hired a friend with a truck to take a load of stuff to the dump, and I paid him double what we agreed because I know the holidays fuck with people, he actually broke down crying thanking me, he's the most well adjusted person I know and yet he's been going through it.

So if my friend Dean is going through it, its BAD OUT THERE, random acts of kindness really do make peoples day, this morning I paid for the next 5 orders at our Coffee shop, I took our Homeless guy to a cafe and paid for a nice breakfast he was besides himself.

Just know this time of the year REALLY MESSES A with people but little thing can be huge moral boosts, I am trying to BE THE CHANGE I WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD, something Dean always says to me, but even your Rock sometimes needs a hand,

So PLEASE do a random act of kindness, and if they want to thank you. Tell them TO PAY IT FORWARD, and BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE. 

Practice a little COMPASSION, the World needs it right now",,
I don't know how to think i don't know what to do i don't know how to find peace i wish i could just disappear from this world everything is messed up now i cant fix it why me why do i have to suffer this way what have i done to anyone to disserve this pain😭😭😭😭,,
Okay.  I'll reword my comment.  It took a severe crisis for my son to be taken seriously concerning his need for long term mental care,,
"I'm new to the group. I don't know how these chats work. I can't afford a counselor. I don't know what I'm supposed to say. Uh, I was an abused child from an alcoholic father from age 4 to 14. I was molested by my 17 year old cousin when I was 10. I was kidnapped by a pedophile when I was 11. I experienced trauma all through my childhood. Then, when I became a teenager, I became a very mean and violent person hurting a lot of people physically. Then, I became addicted to drugs and alcohol and became a drug dealer and criminal. Street fights, gang fights, guns, knives, and it all led to arrests. I've come a long way I guess. I overcame the alcohol and drugs and smoking. I am still struggling with my temper and anger. I now have PTSD, bipolar and fibromyalgia. I have 11 serious injuries and 6 major surgeries that have left me in chronic 24/7 pain over all my body. Now I'm on opioids and gabapentin. I'm not the person I was due to the drugs. I really don't know who I am anymore. I struggle daily with depression and loneliness and suicidal thoughts.",,

"Life will make you a real asshole. The majority of people I cared about in my life either left me in the dirt, betrayed my trust, stole from me, tried to kill me, or something along those lines. I have no love or empathy left for most people. It's 100% a defense mechanism that took years to develop. Maybe I'm becoming narcissistic I don't know I just feel like I'm a huge asshole and there is no trusting people. I'm sniffing for bullshit constantly and I'm ready to pop off on ANYBODY. I disowned my sister not too long ago. Never gonna speak to her again until our parents are dead. I can't imagine trusting another partner. Idk man I just hate nearly all people.",,

"Possible trigger warning:

I've been trying all of the self help tips like journalling, gratitude journalling, meditation, affirmations, exercising to try and heal myself of the abuse and neglect that I experienced from my family, caretakers, teachers and schoolmates growing up, and I'll admit, it works for a little bit. It actually feels really good for a week or two when I do it consistently, but then something happens where I just stop. It's like i get chills down my spine, my body feels weirdly hollow like a ghost, my eyes feel heavy and I feel drowsy. Has anyone else experienced this? 

P.S.
Before you suggest therapy, I can't afford it, which is why I've been trying to heal on my own. I've tried free and low cost options and had a horrible experience. I basically let myself be a guinea pig to masters students, and that left a sour taste in my mouth. I also used the university's counselling services and they were bad. The therapist was dismissive and threw CBT down my throat whereas I needed validation and mirroring.",,
"TRIGGER WARNING, 

I believe I have long covid and back in march i had a really bad time where I couldn't do anything in the house etc, 

Well my son was removed from my care temporarily and I couldn't work out what the symptoms were - I thought I was getting old (back aches) and that I was fat (mobility problems ) and eating junk (breathing problems ) fatigue (anemia etc) sleep problems (stress) 

Plus other issues (10 out of 15 ) and i only noticed yesterday it could be long covid as a reason everything went wrong & I found out today I might never see my son again because they don't care I am ill and said my son better without me, 

So I may lose my beautiful boy for a illness millions of people had,

"I'm so down, my family member is in mental hospital.  I've been left with their dog and to pay any unpaid bills.  I'm into my savings now because I am not allowed family members bank card. Bearing in mind my family member wants me to have my money I have paid out already but not allowed.  Today I had booked a chiropodist for family member and turned up at the hospital to pay them cash, as arranged.  Obv nurse in charge feels she has the authroity not to allow me to see family member and pay the chiropodist cash.  I had to leave the hospital because I can not talk or deal with idiotic people.  So I have had to go against myself and do bank transfer, my way is cash and that's what I organised with the chiropodist, cash.  I know it might sound petty but surly I am allowed to book a service and pay how I decide, it's my money.
They have had my family member a while, like keeping her prisoner as such and reluctant to let them home. I'm sorry but I have no respect for these people in authority, done no favours to me and total upset all day long because of them.  What makes things worse is any correspondence I have had from these so called professionals is that their spelling is atrocious.  If you can not spell or even compose an email better than me, how can I respect someone in authroity.
I might suffer from a bit of depression but the local mental health hospital is messing with me and making me totally more depressed.  My honest opinion they seem a bunch of idiots with spelling worse than mine.   I believe my family member they are holding thinks this too, well on them lines.
Thanks got it off my chest.",,
"How to explain this? 

Okay first of all since I got my surgery for my lacrimal duct I’ve been barely crying cus crying actually makes burn not now as much tough 

So I finally brewer my bottling fuse and sobbed hysterically today 

So my strategy for distraction is whenever I feel hopeless I try not to dwell instead mask it 

I was using drawing and talking to others online to pushing out the pain I was feeling of not going out often down and keeping it bottled 

Cause to be honest I went insane trying to understand this but sadly I cannot drive I’m very prone to anxiety and panic attacks along with blacking out 

So I rely on my mom as a 27 yr old 

Going out in my life is a rare treat 

I get it I got surgery I needed to rest but for gods sake it’s been two weeks since the doctor said I’m free to go out at this point I think you’re being paranoid 

Yes I’m aware we’re not familiar with many places but I don’t think that excuses 

Also yeah it’s awful how stepdad been distant since forever or since we moved to this house on December 25th 2022

But always I suggested stuff it felt like I always begged to go out so I stopped I come to a conclusion I’ll rot in this room and be filled with empty promises cause I’m also teased often of going around this or that place 

Yes I also get how the world is dangerous so there’s that among many many things 

So I poured it out I blew it out 

She heard things she may not want to hear it was important 

I spend most days in my room trying to distract myself and also preventing from us arguing since I overthink and my mind won’t stop running 

Sometimes I often think I shouldn’t have made this surgery okay I dunno 

But she’s like “ we going out tomorrow” 

At this point 

I don’t believe anything anymore I’ve been let down time and time again 

Yeah I get how stuff goes on in her life too I just wish she let me be more dependent and fly free 

Before you go “oh live  alone” 

Thought of that but I often have a gut feeling to where I wouldn’t have luxury I do 

It’s luxury but I pay a price 

Just like she’s with stepdad still for money and comfort life 

I’m with her for the same reason 

We’re both rotten gold diggers and comfort diggers",,
I'm so sick of feeling like this. I lost myself a long time ago. What's worse is I have no emotional support from pretty much anyone especially from those I put my trust in.  Things just keep getting worse and what makes it even harder is most around me just look at me like a screw up loser whatever who knows what they really think...and to be honest I don't care what they think because I know how damn hard I work to survive each day. I also think it's sad that complete strangers treat me better than family and supposed friends. Example...I do door dash and almost literally accidentally ran over an older couple pulling into a parking lot to pick up an order (mind you I've been beyond stressed) and I was like omg I'm so sorry I literally didn't see you I am SOOo very sorry...they both where like no no it's okay your good it happens...I'm thinking dude I almost ran you over I felt so bad even if they were in my blind spot and it was raining I still kept apologizing because I should have been more aware.  The lady goes hun your good have a good day with a smile on her face. 🫣 I literally still feel bad about it but they shrugged it off like it was nothing...why can't I be like that..I get angry over less than that for real now a days and maybe it's because of the consistent stress I'm under and my whole life going to hell but still no excuse for my anger.  Blessed Be I am soooo over everything but I'm really trying to hang in there with no support from a jerk of a spouse (another too long of a story not even worth telling) ugh 😮‍💨,,

"When your child hates you more than the abusive drug user. Says a lot about who you think you are as a parent. For her to feel completely alone while she was in your presence 24/7 is devastating news! I feel like my mere existence is still causing her harm. I wasn't a good mother for sure I was detached from reality for many years, and causing my children harm from my untreated mental health. No words can be said to undo the pain I'll caused them, at times I think the change I'm doing within myself is all for nothing. What has been done, can be undone and for that I'm forever sorry.",,

"Just some thoughts. I’m trying in my mid fifties to progress. After floundering for decades. 

Four ingredients to well being 
1. Occupation or Work
2. Food. 3. Sleep
4. Medication if necessary. 

The problem is a catch 22. For forty years I have not been allowed to get work training. Because I have been deemed too ill. But occupation is as vital as food sleep and medication for being well

Otherwise self esteem will rot and mental health will get worse and worse. I don’t think anyone would deprive me of food or sleep or even my medicine before waiting for me to recover. As in the words of a very top consultant in London “ Work is the best therapy “. And each time I get unwell management decides to delay helping me get volunteering.  It’s the only real cause of my continuing setbacks. I can’t get well without feeling useful in society. aNd feeling useless in society makes me get chronic mental illness. My occupational therapy scheme was withdrawn from me becsuse I felt bad about myself. 

For me the more proactive things are. And I mean really proactive. The better. Being forced to stay in the slow lane despite A levels and published books is very frustrating. I don’t mean to annoy kind supporters who read this. Everyone has helped. I just find it exasperating that work which is like an essential vitamin is constantly something that no care worker is really preparing me intensely enough for. I’m losing weight but I need really really proactivity

There’s one thing much worse than being accelerated and going too fast and that is going too slowly. I have complained week in week out about the heavy sedation I’m on.  I think it is ‘ helpful’ but I believe strongly in going round in circles despite my incredible determination. The pills thoygh generally excellent - one medicine I’ve been on 21 years I think is in the very long run slowing me down 

Doctors and other healthcare workers especially in my life deserve the greatest praise and gratitude. But I would really hope they don’t abandon the greatest intensity of effort to help me out of this pit

Being relegated to mental health care instead of occupational preparation is not going to improve matters. I feel upset. If one falls down in a race one does not go backwards to make more progress. One should take a deep breath and carry on moving forward

Yes I had an episode. I believe that’s why I lost my occupational course. I’m disappointed but it seems for the sake of health caution I will be going round and round this circle forever. I could have done a lot lot more with my life. It’s disappointing. 

I’ve been careless I know but I do have good intentions. It is not an easy trap to escape. sorry for a long post but I’d really appreciate any feedback. 😊",,
"I try not to rely on yesterday or the past lately but I regret answering aunt’s phone call last night she was a huge energy vampire being all dramatic and stuff that today I woke up sort of weird like my energy  is unbalanced

"So this has been happening since February and it's doing my anxiety in, it started on January this year wen I got a letter from the dwp ( ul know wot that is if u live in the UK and for those that don't dwp stands for Department for work and Pensions ) it was a review form for my pip that i won bk in 2020 after trying twice if i hadn't of won i wasn't going to try again so on January i get this form and fill out myself bcus the dwp gave me 30 days so i did it myself which i shouldn't of done i sud of got some1 to help but i didn't want to wait bcus i was worried that the dwp wouldn't extend it tho they wud of done if i asked but i wanted it over and done with so i filled it out and sent it off February this year i get a text from the dwp about my pip review form saying that they have it and will review it as soon as possible i thought ok this went on until July 24th wen I get another text saying the same thing as the one I got in February I've not had one since and ever monday i go into panic mode bcus I'm dreading it bcus i can't go to a face2face like I've done twice before bcus those people are assholes they've no clue wot they are on about and they don't listen like the second time i went this woman cud see wot state my arms were in she cud see that i was mess but gave me zero points but I didn't know that until 2019 had to get my support worker to call them and ask why they are taking so long within a week i get a letter that says zero but i won in 2020 wen I first got my pip bk in 2020 it was used for taxis to and from town now its used for a carer that comes round mine once a week we're trying for twice a week but it keeps falling on deff ears.",,
"So, earlier I was on a downer. Sleep deprived is the contribution and I'm looking for love. But ever since (I have no idea, how many years I've been trying) I've been searching. I consistently get nothing but bad luck. I get ignored, rejected, blocked (for apparently no good reason whatsoever) ghosted, toxic intrusive nonsense, someone who has found someone else. Etc. It's a minefield. My hope and faith of ever finding someone is at zero % I have truly given up, but as it's the human spirit. We keep persevering, but why should I anymore. As it's in vain. There's someone who is interested, I've been chatting with her for weeks. We get on, she seems genuinely interested in me. But she's not keen on meeting up. She's telling me, she's not ready. I feel a connection, but I feel she's just reassuring me by saying that she will meet up. I feel like she's not being honest with me. I have trust issues, as humans have a poor tendency to not be honest. I'm different, I have a honest policy. 

So with this going on. I've lost interest in her. I got depressed because of sleep deprivation and I'm so tired of being alone. I have lost all faith and hope in life. I will die alone. I'm not gonna bother anymore. It's all a waste of time. Thanks to this latest quest, I got emotional and I was crying. I was in deep mental anguish. I suffer so much. I am the world's most unluckiest guy. 

Ironically, I treat them well, I am nice, decent, genuine, honest, loyal. Good and proper manners. Yet I get treated so unfairly. Why? I am so tired of this consistent nonsense. I am cursed with bad luck. I'm done. When this gets to me........I'm sorry I feel that way. I'm crying 😭 again. I have suffered enough. . I am a good guy and yet I get a bad deal. I don't try too hard. I be nice & yet I have to suffer rejection. I hurt so much. I can't stand being alone. Ugh, sorry I am so pathetic. I'm 52 years old and I'm sobbing like a baby.

I think… I’m 90% ready to be social again while guarding myself not to be hurt with others again 

Not to get too attached and let my guard down 

I’ve been online socializing lately for now since I’m still healing for surgery hopefully after the 14th of this month I can back into the social scene 

But yeah I’ve been making connections again since 2020 and it feels pretty damn good 

I’ve woken up and realized I was being manipulated by my mother 

Like I get it you should keep your guard up for people cause it’s not rainbow and sunshine but you shouldn’t be paranoid either 

And listening to her so much her views on people was making me paranoid 

Her level is like 

The other mother from Caroline 

Is the best comparison explanation I can do 

So yeah I follow my gut while not getting myself hurt 

But yeah these last couple of days I’ve been working on my art while socializing on discord 

Now listen yeah I know it’s awful specially discord but if you think about it all is awful 

Every social media 
Every media 
Every celebrity everything that it exists 

But but not all is bad there’s good and bad side to all things 

The world I realize it’s not just black and white thetes so much beauty and ugliness at the same time 

It’s messy but yet it’s so beautiful

"Perhaps I went too delusional thinking things be okay forever 

Everyone around me is weird once again as if the same things happen over and over 

Ya know what 

I’m done 

I don’t care 

Well it hurts but like I am so done overworking now 

If I can’t get along with family around me so be it 

I won’t go depressed and stop my hobbies",,
Hello well today I quit my job as the guy I was working with was harassing none stop for 5 months and with that I confined in him about all the problems I have been having and how my mental health is really bad and he’s been none stop I did so many complaints and nothing was done seriously he accused me of theft even tho I was injured and out of work for 5 weeks he spent most days saying stuff about me and been none stop for months even when I was struggling with a death,,

rom my personal experiences people who are labeled as intellectually disabled/neurodivergent. often have our mental health concerns brushed off by professionals because a lot of professionals assume that people labeled as intellectually disabled/neurodivergent, can not have mental illnesses because of our other diagnosis. 

yet those who are labeled as intellectually disabled/neurodivergent. 
are often very quickly and without proper cause or based on what  family and caregivers say. put on psychiatric medications to control what society see as inappropriate or bad behaviour. 

i was put on my first psychiatric medication at age 12 to control what was considered violent behaviour. 

which unknown to anyone because i am AFAB(assigned female at birth) until i was diagnosed at 30 with autism.

where autistic meltdowns do to not being able to express my emotions and feelings is a way the society deems acceptable. do i still have autistic meltdowns? not really. as i have grown the meltdowns changed to shut downs which are kinda sorta easier to manage. 

do i have mental illness?absolutely i have multiple mental illnesses 

but thankfully i have a really good team of professionals and other people in my life now",,
Thanks for letting me join the group 🤩,,
"I never thought I’d see the day where I practically I don’t really need this group much for support due to being well balanced both in spirits in mind 

I’m healing from surgery more and more as days go on my scab is almost fully off and my eyes aren’t leaking so much anymore only sometimes due to the stent but September 14th I wait for you baby it is the day the  it off and hopefully I hear good news about my progress

I was looking at this medicine eye drop prescription and I have 5 prescriptions to go according to what he said 

Hope all it goes well I can feel it already",,
"So, I'm done with quetiapine. After taking a dosage of 100mg last night. I went to bed sometime after 21:20. I woke up this morning at 11:45. Fifteen hours sleep! Absolutely ridiculous. I am aware of this stupid side effect. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. So I'm gonna discuss a med review. I've been on them for weeks and they are making no difference to my mental health. I feel lousy and lethargic at the moment. I don't want to feel like this and I'm done with downing that type of antidepressant. I'm feeling emotional now and I'm tired of being alone. I was supposed to meet up a friend today at noon and I tired to get to the arranged place. I had to text to let her know I was running late and arranged to meet later. But I got to a certain place before the rendezvous. But I had to turn back and go home. As I felt awful. Stupid ridiculous antidepressant. Thanks, for messing my plan for today. I'm now home and I'm tired of being alone. I wish I made a effort to meet up with my friend. I'm so useless and stupid. I don't need this stupid ridiculous antidepressant and this nasty horrible side effect! 

I feel lousy at the moment and not in the best of moods. Is there anyone free to chat?",,
"For the longest time I thought healed people aligned with energy did shadow work stayed in good vibes 24/7 and didn’t have a bad day 

That’s unrealistic and untrue 

Today I feel awful like I’ve been hit by  a thousand bricks 

And there’s no like proper reason I feel so down I just do 

Like my energy and the tune with the universe is off or something 

I feel angry, upset and just empty 

As always it will pass 

Maybe it’s because I overdid hobbies by accident or something that got me drained 

I’m taking it easy to scroll through memes on tik tok and watch cartoons 😎",,
M upset cos iv been tryna get a job for ages and I got offered a web development volunteering job and manager said that after 3 to 6 months once iv finished a task will consider me for a job but now she hasn't given me the task and my parent's think that it's a scam :'(,,
"I’m starting to regret ever meeting those girls it’s been 3 days since I haven’t talked for the best but I feel so empty part of me wants to go after something that was toxic to me 

I need to finally realize to isolate myself for good so I won’t suffer 

My vibes when I’m not attacked or anything are too good that it attracts broken insecure people 

As a extreme empath I get drained by energies easy…. So yeah I’m so down I have been sleeping in and very upset 

I wish I would never meet them",,

"I’ve been struggling ￼ I went through a lot as a kid and for fear of triggering or offending anyone I won’t get into it unless I asked, but I just went through so much and then as a team I put myself in a really not great situation and now as an adult I feel like I can’t even function I just feel like a broken person I lost my job six months ago and I’ve been busting my ass trying to find a new one and there’s just nothing. I’ve gotten a review here and there, but no calls back. The money that I had saved is gone and I can’t even afford to buy my medication and so I’m in a really low place and I live in the middle of nowhere so there’s no support groups for me to physically go to. I just feel like I have no one",,
"I think I found out why I was acting so insane and not myself 

So on messenger I’m on this group chat and lately for some reason things have been heavy there’s these two girls who has been super negative about things about the pettiest reasons also and for me I’m very senstive to energy I’ll absorb extra and lately I’ve been getting this heavy energy that’s been driving me nuts 

So I disappeared out of the blue cause often it’s okay to do so 

You don’t own explanation to no one cause often people won’t listen and it will give you more a hard time 

But ye it’s been two days and I’ve been relaxed again and I’m not sure if I wanna go back 

One thing I realized in my 20’s is to hang or do what is good for me and this is not the vibe so I’ll stay away as it’s not being useful 

Still wish people would take it easy and not emotionally torture themselves 

But oh well",,
"****Potential TW****
Childhood trauma,  adult trauma.

I have a question for everyone, I appreciate that it might be slightly different for everyone, 

As the oldest child I was never wanted by by stepfather, my mum wouldn't say anything, I was constantly bullied by my siblings, by anyone really, at school, my granddad told my really dad before I was born he was not welcome forcing him out of my life, before my mum meet my stepdad she pushed me away to my aunties every weekend. My stepdad grounded and bullied me for the slightest thing  I ended up moving in with my grandparents at the age of 9 they didn't want me. So everytime I picked myself up tried again.
Anyway in my adult life it was the same, I married she had an affair with my stepbrother which virtually everyone in my family knew about and they encouraged.  Then from then on I've been getting back up, I am 51 now, the thing is I know everyone says get up dust yourself off, I have been for over 47 years, I moved away, still get the same crap where I go. I am seriously unsure how much more of being knocked down I can take",,
"I know one’s insecurity is solved on their own but in my case I can’t just get out of this loop of insecurity like I want to get stuff done but then I go back on my word and I hate or I want a food or a drink and I go back on my world and I’m just so disgusted with myself 

I’m not the person to care what others think but lately I’m doing that and I wanna it to stop 

I tried it all but I biult 400 doubts in my mind and I give myself self anxiety 

Please help this hell stop",,

"I’m feeling a bit lost feel free to delete it but thinking over and over is killing me 

I say feel free to delete cuz it’s not mental health related but hair related 

As you all know I’m still healing from surgery but once I can do normal stuff again ima get my hair dye touched up and a new cut cuz it’s looking so dull so anyways 

Lately I’m highly invested in both side undercut idk the sight of seeing not fully shaved head makes me so happy it just looks so cool specially with bangs lmk If I can post the reference photo 

I heard the pros and cons tbh I’m not bothered however idk who to share in person since I don’t have many people in my life so I shared with mom today and she gave me a look and said “so just bangs? That looks odd I dunno today’s people hair cuts” 

And idk it made me unsure even tho I want it so bad 

My heart since the age of 16 always been into tattoos, hair dyes and piercing which I want it all 

Life is short I wanna feel comfortable in my skin as possible but 

Only thing holds me back how my family reacts which idk why it makes me hesitant so I get repressed and unease wanting stuff but unsure 

For the ones who has is it so bad are the cons  bad? Do the pro  weight the  con out?",,

"Hallo everyone, my name is Fabrizio and I was diagnosed with emotional instability. and post traumatic stress disorders  
Now my question is for the people up there they know all , why do you think that does illness as ppl consider, are synonym of violence and lais?
Can you understand that in some cases like mine it is the opposite.
Some mental problems come when the people think they see the illness and not the person.
What do you think?",,
OK so I've agreed to the section,,
"I’m not even sure who to ask this question so I post here and yes it’s surgery related only because my doctor won’t answer whenever I go for check up it’s usually very quickly he is also my surgeon so he is often doing surgery 

He told me to eat whatever 
Do whatever but he did not answer me this 

I know within 3 months is my next appointment to remove my eye stent but my question is 

If anyone had a surgery similiar to mine

How long did it take you to get back to your normal life routine? Like going out and such 

For me if it wasn’t for the barely bruise since it’s fading a lot and scar scabs along with the stent I’m pretty much all healed my nose barely hurts from time to time 

I only ask bc I’m starting to miss going out and I find myself somedays getting into a small depression funk even tho I’m engaging on hobbies 

I wanna see how much I should wait more 

I can’t believe in these almost 6 months now I’ve been struggling kinda makes me sad which I avoid thinking not to be upset",,
"I’m looking for a little advice here. I have an almost 4y/o and my husband and I are thinking about trying for baby #2 in the next few months. I feel ready, I’m excited, and this is something I really want. However, I’m terrified. When my son was 6 months old, I was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and I began having really disturbing intrusive thoughts that I was going to intentionally harm him. This kept getting worse and worse as he got older and I ended up in the hospital twice after he turned 3 (SI/attempts). If convinced myself that if I was around, my baby was in danger, and I wasn’t about to let that happen. I came across a journal I kept during that time (suggested by my therapist), and what I wrote in it is extremely disturbing. I was talking about hating my life, hating my son, hating my husband, etc. at that point, I was doing harm to myself physically.

I’ve been great for 7+ months now, and have spoken with my OB, therapist and psychiatrist who have all cleared me as safe to get pregnant, but I’m still terrified. 

I know no one can tell me what to do, but any advice/experience/opinion is welcome. I want another baby, but I want to make sure myself and everyone I love would be safe if that happened.",,
"Long post, I had all this in my head and needed to get it all out. 

For the past few months I've been suffering. Mostly from my own making. 

I've been too scared of the world outside of my front door, to see or speak to people would make me physically sick. 

To be in such a dark place, a place so lonely so misunderstood a place where leaving your family behind becomes an option is so hard to explain. 
I've wanted to live and die in the same breath, I've wanted to defend and scold myself, I've wanted to run and stay. 
 Noone is infallible we have all made bad choices in life but I'm learning and being told that what you do or did doesnt define you, your actions after are what count. 

I have apologiesed, and done all I can to right my wrong. I can only do that. What people choose to believe or think of me beyond that is out of my control another thing I'm learning to deal with.

I'm wanting to become a better person. But I also have to understand perfection is not achievable, for anyone. 

I have since loosing my mum suffered with my mental health, but I'm also a stubborn and independent person and so have constantly denied how much help I've actually needed. So I have painted on a smile and made it through each day with more or less know one knowing the real emotions of the day. Having high functional depression just means your Ill but your running constantly from everything.

I've been snappy, happy, sad, excited, lonely, exhausted and pretty much every other emotion in one day all because my 'mask' required me to. Asking for help didn't feel like an option and on the occasions I did I have just been handed tablets and told they would 'make it better' They don't they just stop you feeling the real pain and instead you feel numb and a constant inability to understand why you just can't feel better. 

I've lived like this for years.  Years of pretending years of asking myself why I'm not good enough why I am the way I am. 

Recently the 'feelings bucket' became so full that It all started to spill out. My behaviour became erratic I lost all interest in everything I pretended to want to move my life in a different direction but the reality was I wanted everything to just end. 

Leaving your family your children, the lives you grew, love and raised behind with the thought of taking your own life is something you can not describe. 
Breaking the trust with the man you love who has tried so hard in the past to help you whilst you constantly throw it back at him was not as easy as I thought it would be. 

Walking away I thought was the right thing to do. But coming back was the hardest thing to do and that was the right thing to do. 
What's so difficult to understand is that I have wanted help and asked for help but when your told time and time again that the waiting list is to long or you don't meet the criteria, go private you really are left with a feeling of maybe I am better off dead. 

But suddenly I'm getting lots of help so much. There are so many organisations and services out there but YOU have to find them. 
When your in a dark place of despair that is a daunting task and the reason so many don't. 
If your struggling please make that first step. Talking to someone is much easier that you think and the judgement you think you will receive isn't there. 
I spent 20 mins crying ... No sobbing to a doctors receptionist, she didn't judge she spoke to me she told me to let it all out and the when I could take a breath and just tell her what I could. Because of that simple act I was suddenly on the path that will I hope make everything better for me. 
I have spoken to so many people and said things I honestly didnt know was inside me. I still have a long way to go but I'm now wanting to get better and I know I can. 

I have listened to audiobooks about the importance of self care, something I actually thought I did untill I heard the words that showed me I actually didn't/don't care for myself at all. 

I've taken up hobbies that I didn't have before so that I can do things to take me out of my own head. Colouring has been such a life line, I've spent hours building my children's Lego I've started yoga, this is self care. 

Now I have a goal that really should be so simple... To leave my house to be able to walk outside my front door. I have only just been able to sit in my garden a place I absolutely loved to be but it was to scary to be there but with help and support I've got there and I know that I'll get to everyone of my goals with that same help and support but also with self belief. I am worth the help I'm getting something I truly believed I wasn't. 

My children and my husband (sometimes 😉) have been my rock. They have held me when I've cried. Listened when I have talked and sat with me when I needed silence never once pushed me and only offered encouragement. 
The love and understanding makes me so proud and is teaching me that whilst I don't think I'm being a good mum to them right now I am educating the on the importance of mental health issues how much talking is needed. Problems won't go away with out it. 
This is an invaluable life lesson for us all. 
This will as a family make us so much stronger but also the ability to cope with the inevitable hurdles that will come our way. 
I hope that my children will because of this become equipped to help and support their friends and partners having a much deeper understanding. 
It's so easy to say if you ever need me just yell or I'm always here.... Showing up is when you really show you care. I hope now they can and will always be able to see the difference. 

My friends have been fabulous, some for doing exactly what I've wanted and staying away leaving me alone after sending me several messages and getting no reply. For this I am greatful. 
Others have been more persistent, but in the nicest possible way. The best possible way, they have gently reminded me they are there and going nowhere, they have checked in knowing they may not get a reply. They have checked in on my family making sure they are ok to. For this I'm eternally greatful. Life has a funny way of showing you what is or isn't or who is or isn't important. I've always believed that everything happens for a reason and I'm being taught so very much right now.",,
"So this is me, my name is Victoria tho I wasn't born with that name bcus I'm trans I'm 54 yrs old and not on treatment ( i won't go into why I'm not on treatment ) I've a daughter who's 32 this August and she wants nothing to do with again, this isn't the first time she's done it and it won't be the last ( she also suffers from mental health issues ) which is no excuse to how she's treating me i don't go out like i used too bcus I've been beat up more times than I can count and one of those people was my second ex gf 😡 i can't do makeup bcus without my glasses on everything is one big blur and sadly I've no who can do that for me the person who did that is no longer my friend bcus wen she found out that I hear voices she said i sud be in a mental hospital 😡 so we are no longer friends and my other friends just stopped being my friend i find it difficult being around people bcus of 2 things the voices that I hear and my social anxiety i keep to myself for 2 reasons 1st reason is bcus of the voices and the second is bcus i don't like being around people for to long bcus of the voices most days i wake up anxious and depressed that's why I'm not on fb much.",,
Heal yourself because you deserve peace,,
"My boyfriend can do research online and every article he reads he can tell is fact and not bullshit. But when I do research online he says you can't trust what you read and that I don't know which websites have valid information. 

We're in a disagreement about is wet or dry food better for your dogs. I've found several sources that state that they both have benefits but he's insisting that dry food has no nutritional value and is no benefit to our dogs. Despite the fact that our oldest two have dental issues and I've read multiple things that say that dry food helps prevent dental issues and based on that information and the fact that our dogs eat only wet food and our oldest two have teeth and gum disease I can see how those are accurate and valid statements but he still wants to argue that our dogs wouldn't benefit from hard food. I'm saying they should have a balanced diet of both. But that's still not an agreeable answer for him. Although he says he will feed them whatever I buy them. I just know if he doesn't think they should eat dry food. He either won't feed it to them or he will find some way to complain and make it seem like wet food is better and the dogs don't like the dry. Despite the fact that I'm the only one working and buying the food and a strictly wet diet is very expensive. 

My point is. I don't know who is crazy anymore. I feel like he's constantly manipulating me or twisting facts or talking in circles or even contradicting himself but when I point out the inconsistencies he acts like what I'm saying is completely fabricated. Like I'm just hearing things that he's not really saying. And I'm losing my fucking mind. All of our arguments are like this. Whether it's about what food the dogs should eat. What medications our autistic daughter should take. What grown up information my teenage daughter should know. They're all just in circles and have no answers or any way to be resolved. I feel like I'm talking to a wall. But I'm also not sure if I'm the problem. He says he's open minded but the things he says comes off pretty closed minded to me and idk. I'm just feeling insane these days.",,

But with me being impatient, hyper and all over the place funny enough this surgery recovery is teaching me patience and discipline 

I spend most days watching anime or Keeping up with the Kardashians which I started binge watching to cure boredom im on season 8 lol it’s funny but yeah I never thought this surgery would teach me those thing and more gratitude I felt I took things for granted CANT wait till this is over tho and I’ll return to normal tasks",,
Just woke up from a disaster dream I used to see this dream before and never actually seem what it means I dream about that I was in a city place with houses and beaches and suddenly there was dark all around and there were tornadoes 🌪 we all saw that and we was running to hiding places at houses that didn't work at houses and then we was hiding at underground places the whole city people was there so was I and the tornadoes were coming that place saved us and then I don't remember the dream but I keep seeing them and I don't what does this dream means I would like to find out dies anyone knows or experience the same dream?,,
"Mental health is so much stigma   for me getting help os extremely difficult, as i cant do it alone. Yet im struggling mentally, emotionally and i cant do anything, in regards to my coping/calming mechanisms without fear of judgement,  which lead to me feeling stuck,  i need to talk to someone,  yet being registered disabled,  my mum is my career and she believes that i have nothing wrong,

"Other than having mental health issues i also suffer with dry eyes which is a pain in the ass to say the least for the past few days my eyes have been playing up really bad thankfully today they seem to be ok ( but knowing my luck I've just jinxed myself by saying that ) also the voices have been playing up no end that's nothing i can do about the voices apart from playing video games but some times playing video games don't work with the voices and no i don't have schizophrenia which wud of made sense if it was but it's not iv eupd, madd, social anxiety and borderline bipolar and tbh i didn't think borderline bipolar was a thing but it is according to the psychiatrist that I saw yrs ago he said that the bipolar comes with having eupd yet eupd is like BPD but unlike BPD is eupd can overlap into other disorders apparently but I wouldn't wish wot i have on any body bcus it's not great especially madd which is mixed anxiety and depressive disorder that means I get both at the same time which init self isn't a gd thing as most days i wake up anxious and depressed means I'm stuck in bed or on the sofa and find it difficult to take my meds which isn't great tbh it's a nightmare and can last a long time the longest was 6 months that was last yr and the voices i hear i hear them every waking moment of every day they get worse if I'm around ppl for to long I'm not going to say wot happens.",,

I just feel lost, broken.",,
"I'm hurting so bad right now and for the first time after everything I've gone through since the pandemic and everyone I lost, I don't want to be here any more. This world is too cruel. This world doesn't deserve a kind hearted person like me and I think my spirit would be better off somewhere else. After losing my mom,, aunt, best friend, 2 cousins, my job of 11 years and and even my 17 yr old dog all because of covid, my wife who suffers from mental illness stopped taking her meds and disappeared with all my valuables and my children and tried to destroy our beautiful new home that I had just bought out here in the lonely country of West Ga last year and I wasn't able to get any help. As hard as it was to cope, I managed through the help of the mental health community. I even started a website so that I could help others going through what I'm going through because I know how hard it is. But I never would've thought I would find love again as I'm a broken man who has suffered and was afraid to move on. One day I'm playing a mobile game and through the chat of this game I met what I thought was the most beautifully spirited, understanding and loving girl I've ever met and after weeks of chatting which is something I don't even do, I fell madly in love with this person. After 2 months of sharing the most intimate details of my life with who I thought was my true soul mate, I proposed and was so excited that she accepted and that's when I thought God answered my prayers. But last night by accident, I ended up finding the real person behind the 150+ photos that this imposter has been using to scam me and it broke my heart. After reaching out to who I thought was my true love to find out what's going on, this person still won't come clean. As beautiful as the girl in the pictures are, looks didn't matter to me because I fell in love with this person's heart but yet this person still won't reveal their true self. We would stay up all night chatting and sharing our days with each other. My heart is so broken. I haven't slept. I can't eat and all I've done is cried. I truly am alone. Surrounded by the most ravenous sharks in deep water with no way out. I know people are going to say pray but I pray faithfully every single day. I even fast every Monday to help me connect with God. But now that my already once shredded heart has now been completely crushed and torn to pieces I don't know why else I'm here. I just want to have someone to love and share my life with but someone who will love me equally. But now I see there is no such thing. I've always been told that I am rare because of how I love and that the world is a better place with me in it because others could learn from me but how true is this? This can't be the world they're talking about because this world is full of hate, betrayal, and cruelty. I don't want to be a part of that anymore. I don't have anyone left to talk to so I am truly alone. None of us were meant to be alone. There's somebody for everybody except for me. So maybe it's time for me to move on. I've never felt like this before but I accept it. I can't take anymore. I know everyone is going to say the same thing they've conditioned themselves to say but I don't need kind words what I need is love. If you're someone I can talk to please DM me because I don't know how this FB stuff works and I'm posting anonymous so that my family doesn't get involved. All they do is judge and really don't care. If you want to see what I look like respond to this post and I will gladly share video or something with you so that you know I am real and not a scammer💔😔😢😭",,

Before I sought professional help, I use to smoke cannabis to suppress my nightmares and my anxiety but truth be told it just made it worse but I didn't see till I got professional help.

I do count to 10 in my head technique and zone out it works wonders

"I’m so glad I finally have settled down enough for my two month period who was late finally has come 

Whenever I get too stressed and all it can delay I remember back in my teens it delayed up to 5 months and that worried me so much but the reason was constant stress 

That stopped in my adult years but it has come back because of my eye problem I’ve been tense for four months non stop without any breaks 

Even grey hair started to come out they have disappeared as I calmed down 

But I’m glad it came even tho I suffer extra due to delay because besides the eye stress I was also hormonal so my mood swings were insane and I was hysterical non stop 

Now I’m calm cool collected 

Now that I took cramp pills i shall cover myself in warm blankets find a nice position and chill 

Maybe sleep even cause im still fixing my sleep schedule but ye I’m glad I got my period cuz I was beginning to be concerned",,

I didn’t know too much 

So I wouldn’t overthink

I wish even tho it would be fantasy 

Id stayed in my own little world and ignore what the world really is 

Like it’s not gonna effect me so why should I worry so much? And yet I do 

I wish I saw the good in people again and be more optimism 

I know I’m dealing with this lacrimal duct problem which finally will get solved on thursday which I’m happy I’d stop crying over spilled milk 

All I can try is not look into things deeply and do what I enjoy to bring me peace

I’m tired of constantly being stressed for 4 months straight now 

I wanna go back into my own little happy world 

I need to find right books to read and podcasts to motivate me tho 

And more hobbies 

I can do all of these after my surgery and after I get healed 

I’ll focus on myself again 

I’ll take a lovely bubbly bath with scents 

Get a dye job done on my hair 
Maybe cut it 
Go into places 
Discover new things 

Those are my plans once this unpleasant situation is all sorted out 

Then I can be happy 

Meanwhile anime and my stuffed animals shall give me comfort and I’ll slowly settle down cause I’m tired of feeling sorry for myself",,

"Ugh being sleep deprived due to having rude wake up calls cause of my eye acting up with extreme stinging because of this dreadful lacrimal duct very early in the morning is making me change my mood be tense again and very angry 

I did what I usually do apply eye drop, eye cream and spray nasal spray cause how they’re linked to each other while in a bit of pain and wanting to go back to sleep but I’m in fear if I close eyes it will get worse cause the duct is clogged and it only behaves decently if I have my eye open and when I close it suffocated which is why I deal with this bs every morning 

I cried many times before I’m drained from crying 

My whole body is tensed up 

I’m scrolling through funny memes to get my mind off

"Part 2
I have been on constant fight with myself whether to go on with this but today I had a trigger. I get used to seeing police officers in and out of our compound and later my dad was unseen or heard.Later I came to realize he had been arrested and was in police custody.All this time Grandma had shifted to a different village and my mother was heavily pregnant with her second born.This woman must have gone through a lot.
This phase of my life is totally blank in my mind because the next event I see us shifting from our village to a different village.it was on a rainy evening and everything was packed up on a tractor apparently the white settler had excommunicated my mother due to the husbands action.I remember being rained on and I saw my mother cry all the way.
We started a new life,I made new friends and neighbors.It was time to join kindergarten and my mum took me to a school that was quite a distance from our home as it was the only school around.I had to walk to and from in the middle of farms as farming was the main activity of the villagers. I remember one day on my way home I met with a man at one corner he said hi and told me shake hands which I innocently did only to realize it was not his hand but penis🫢.I got confused but luckily there was someone approaching so he had to run away.I never told anyone about this but every time I would get there I would get so scared and tensed.Upto date I really have lots of questions on what would have happened if no one showed up.I was a smart pupil as mostly the class teacher would leave me teaching my classmates.Also Kindergarten takes 3 years then was baby class to middle class then top before joining primary school but for me I did 2years as the teachers said they could not contain me one more year.
During my kindergarten days I have memories of my dad visiting and would bring me magazines which I would read and flow smoothly.He would not believe it.There was also constant fights between my parents that I would mostly hear late at night.I would severaly hear my mother sob from her bedroom.This period my dad had started selling thrift clothes in town as his Aunt had taken him in and employed him.Though again he was not a regular at home.My Mum had began farming and also would do some manual jobs to take care of me and my brother.
I had an interview to transit from Kindergarten to primary school My dad took me.I did well as I was the leading pupil from all schools who had participated that day.My dad bought me bread and some Fanta soda and it was a happy day for me.This is also the last day I saw him in a long period of time.

"**Depression** is a complex mental health condition, and there are many factors that can contribute to its prevalence in modern times. Here are some possible reasons why people may be experiencing depression more frequently now:
1. Increased stress: Modern life can be hectic and stressful, with work, family, and financial pressures. This stress can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which are common symptoms of depression.
1. Social isolation: With the rise of social media and remote work, many people are spending more time alone, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
1. Trauma: Experiences of trauma, such as abuse, violence, or natural disasters, can trigger or exacerbate depression.
1. Environmental factors: Environmental factors such as air pollution, noise pollution, and lack of access to green spaces can also impact mental health and contribute to depression.

5.    Stigma: Despite progress in reducing stigma surrounding         mental health, negative attitudes and discrimination towards           people with mental health conditions can still make it difficult           for individuals to seek help and recover.

**It's important to note that everyone's experience of depression is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all explanation for why people may be experiencing it more frequently now.**",,

"Is anyone with sza not on an antipsychotic?

I was for 20 some years and I keep being non compliant.  I will try to research if other countries besides the United States treat sza with other therapies.  

I read at one point that not all countries use aggressive psychoactive drug interventions with this illness.  I want to know.  Whatever is going on with me is really hard.  I can’t stay on meds but I can’t continue to go off amd on them too.  

I don’t have support though.  And when I had an issue my family and husband kept threatening to institutionalise me.  

I’ve been in hospitals and they are awful. 
I get social and sensory overload issues and I could not take a bath to relieve stress, let alone a normal shower.  And I thought I was going to die on the meds I was given.  

Hospitals are not a great solution and neither are drug cocktails of 3 pills and seven more to relieve the side effects of three.  
My brain feels like it’s been endlessly under attack with the substances given to me by medical doctors!  It’s time I learn all the treatments available and learn what other countries do.  

Has anyone in this group ever questioned if they have autistic spectrum and not sza?

Hello, I recently had a relapse in eating disorder recovery.  I wanted to share the things I learned from it in hopes that someone would benefit from them and in order to destigmatize talking about things like this.

1) Presence and awareness allow you to see more clearly what it is that you need to learn.  What does that even mean?  It means ***accepting*** that this (relapsing) is where you are at and ***watching*** yourself go through what it is that you need to go through with ***curiosity*** and without judgment.  This is by no means my first relapse (I have had EDs for 20+ years), but it is the first one that I was able to bring this presence and awareness into the experience.  It is a shift in the mindset from viewing relapse as a failure to a growth opportunity.

2) Non-judgment, kindness, and compassion for yourself allow you to get through a relapse more easily.  When you accept that relapses may happen and can be beneficial for your growth, you won't judge yourself and get caught up in guilt and shame.  Guilt and shame can keep you stuck repeating your trauma cycles and prolong getting back to recovery.  You deserve kindness and compassion from yourself, especially in your darkest moments.

3) Addiction patterns and trauma cycles are literal, physical neural networks in your brain.  I had the knowledge of this from working with my therapist but the physical reality of this really hit home with this relapse.  I didn't feel much pain in my digestive system the day after a binge/purge episode.  However, I did experience what felt like a frontal lobe migraine that kept me bedridden for over 24 hours.  The reason for this is because the neural networks in my brain that stored my trauma responses and that I had been working on healing for years suddenly got ripped open again.

I hope that this benefits somebody.  If you can learn from what I went through without having to go through what I went through, that would be really great.  :)  If you are currently struggling with an eating disorder and would be willing to share your experience, I would be honored to hear your perspective.",,

Hi everyone this post is gona be a rollercoaster but please bare with me , I have been diagnosed with ADHD/BPD ever since i was a young  and it has been so difficult when it comes to therapy and accepting therapy, I got into mental institution at the age of 16 , imagine going to a mental institution in a 3rd world country , I was treated like shit that when eventually when I was out I was more truamtized than before the following years I was totally broken and was very impulsive and my mother diagnosed with bi polar didn't make life easier she had a severe eating disorder and she would tell me horrible stuff because I am overweight and eating was a way for me to comfort myself  then after I finshed high school , I made a group of toxic people that was my downfall as I was impulsively doing drugs / alcohol but after a year of that I lost one of my friends due to SA and what breaks my heart more he loved me and I treated him like shit , he tried telling me he needed help I just stopped trying to help him cuz I stopped caring at some moment until I got the news he SA... and I traveled to Malaysia finshed my college degree now I am back to Egypt, working a 12 hour shift that pays a total of 250 dollars , keep it mind egypt economy is do bad so this is actually in egypt a good salary , I am working as a customer service representative I keep hearing complains and people shouting and it doesn't stop to this my manger is so toxic and treats me unfairly , yesterday I told her I feel sick she went and escalated the case to the account manger that I always get sick and that's so upsetting because I'm always on time and I am always doing my best so thar broke my heart and I cried a lot , she told me he was checking on you that's all but still that was my first communication with the acc manger she just made my image look weak while I was hard to keep a good image and to be always on time and doing a good job despite me being a new employee.
Anyways,I am trying to travel outside of egypt but I am very scared/worried because I can't seem to find a cheap English speaking country where I can feel comfortable, or I am thinking getting into a cosmetology school to be able to get a visa there and looking for a part time.job but I don't know what country would suit me on my case.

"TRIGGER WARNING: DRUG USE RELATED QUESTION...  My best friend a long time heroin user, discovered Phenomenal about four weeks ago, about the last time anyone heard from him. Well his dad called me yesterday to inquire about Paul, I told him it had been about as long since I have heard from him and I said Tomorrow will take the ferry into the city and check in on him and report  back.

Which I am doing tomorrow, I need a day to prepare me head. I was diagnosed with AIDS IN 1986, and one doesn't survive the worst of it by pumping garage madeoisens into their body, I have a very strong mind body practice, and one of the top wholeistic healers in the country...

Now my question seeking advice...

I have been trying to educate myself on phenomenal addiction, and everything I have read tells me life expectancy for a hard core addict is about 6 weeks,. I had a stroke about 6 months ago and can no longer think on my feet, and I don't lie EVER.

So at PAULS impending funeral, I know his dad is going to approach me and want to know the skivvy. I feel strongly it's not my take to tell, and I don't want his Dad feeling JUST MAYBE IF... and spending the rest of his life wondering,

Is it fair to say I tried many times to get him help, and once stayed in treatment With him four 4 week to try to free him from that deemon, The drug is just too good the only way to beat it is to never use it. And he crossed that bridge. I was supportive till he started stealing and shooting people to get it, I couldn't abide by the violence to, so I didn't become a victim I had to minimize contact..

But what do I tell his Dad, who idolizes Paul, do I piss all over Pss all over Paul's !memory, or allow him to have his fantasy who Paul was.

I am currently thinking, A day, a week, A month, the second he made the choice to try that drug, the outcome was foretold.

I am of half a mind to tell him he was very special to Paul, and if there was a way Paul would have tried it, there is just no coming back",,

I am having a hard time making friends and understanding people I don’t understand myself I am not working anymore because I was not myself I really liked this guy even tho we never texted out of work or communicated out of work but I really wanted to be around him I asked him to hang out and he agreed multiple times even said he was free on a certain day and still never showed up and this tends to happen to me a lot I always like one person and when they don’t feel the same I go into a complete breakdown I felt like he liked other people more than me and rather be around them then me and I was losing him although he wasn’t mine and even tho I told him I liked him i wasn’t sure he liked me too I was always excited to see him at work and he was the highlight of my day now that it’s gone i don’t know if I can go back but I want to go back because I feel like they’ll win I’ve been trying to go to therapy and the hospital we waited 6 hrs at the hospital and had no help I want to be admitted but I have social anxiety and agoraphobia so I am scared i break down when I feel like I am less important to them than they are to me and I was trying to make friends aswell and let people talk down to me just because I wanted friends because I don’t have any I felt weak and felt they were happier without me and laughing at me I feel like I am not strong enough for this.

It hurts me and I don’t know why I just wanted to be around him I don’t understand what I did and I don’t want to be alone anymore but I only choose certain people I want to be around is that selfish I felt like I was loosing him even though we weren’t friends I thought we were though we never texted or hung out outside of work but I felt we were friends.

"‼️ TRIGGER WARNING ‼️

Posting anon as I haven’t told anyone yet as I’m still trying to wrap my head around it 

Basically, I have a background of depression and anxiety, it’s always been there, up and down (I’m sure you know the drill) 

But today I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, and told that’s why I have the depression and anxiety symptoms (was in a very abusive relationship for 4 years) 

So the point of the post, I’m starting therapy for it in the new year and I was just wondering if anyone has been through therapy for this kind of thing and could let me know what to expect? I’m seriously dreading having to relive the whole experience but I know it’s what I need to do if I’m going to move past it

"Tw… my story 

My story..

When I was 14 the county council for children gave up on me…

A little background. I was placed into care at 4. Fostered till 7 then placed with a failed adoption home untill 11. I then went back to Worcester county council. Where I was placed in diffrent homes around Worcestershire. 

At first I lived in a 6 bed children’s home. At 11 seeing kids old as 16-17 smoking drinking self harming. Kicking off. It was daunting. I ended up self harming. Distorying my belongings and even trying to end my life. 

The staff tried to help but sadly where not trained well enough to handle these behaviours… 

This was the first of many things that was wrong with Worcester. 

My next home was in wyre piddle. (Pershore) a 3 bed home. Much better suited to my needs… how ever there was a younge person there that at 12 years old scared me! 

He was vilont and would self injur himself in front of me. The police were called many times. 

This causing my mental health to get worse. And at this point I was to damaged for the incorrectly trained staff to help me! 

I ended up needing to go into respite (aka short breaks) to a home in Manchester. That I hated! I told them never ever put me there again! 

Anyways. 6 weeks later I was back in wrye piddle this home was now moving (the whole home) to a new building in Worcester! 

It’s name was oak house…

By the time I got there I was damaged. I had seen things no 13 year old would have to see.  But for care kids “it was normal” at this point they did not know they had caused me c-ptsd! They did not know that I was depressed! Yet if they had been given the right training and the right help from therapists they might have known! 

Whilst living at oak house. I started to try and find myself again. Tried to find where I belonged. I felt some what safe there. Even tho my behaviour may have said otherwise… 

But by this point rather than trying to help me they had secret meeting discussing what they was gonna do with me… had no one thought about therapy… counciling… finding safe coping strategies… 

Towards the end of this placement I was screaming for help. Yet no one was able to see this… in the end they gave up on me. I was removed from this home placed in Mottingham where I was beaten abused and neglected… then lied to and moved back to Manchester where they lied to me. Twisted my words. Locked me away. And treated me like crap! 

Socail workers. Carers and mangers choice to give up on me rather than finding a way to set me straight! Rather than seeing all I needed was routine. Rules! And a reset button! 

But no! They gave me never ending suffering! C-ptsd! Mental health issues! And a life I’m not proud of! 

Now I know these homes are not to fault even tho they are the issue! I know the real issue lays with the way they are run. By who they are run! And by what they have to offer… 

But knowing these things doesn’t give me and 100s like me justice! Every time it gets quite I still hear the screams of kids being restrained. Every time I close my eyes I am scared to open them incase I’m back in those homes. Every time I sleep I am disturbed by the nightmares I once lived through! I can’t go back to where I called home incase I see my old staff… when I do I have break downs for days! 

All this pain and suffering because Worcester children first choice not to put me. A child! First…",,

This got me taking over 100 paracetamol and got me cutting my wrists and placed me in hospital as a teen.

"How being outside can trigger the flow state of mind
1. What is flow?
Flow state describes a feeling where, under the right conditions, you become fully immersed in whatever you are doing. In this state, your mind is extraordinarily sharp and able to create effortlessly, and you're joyful and often humorous.
2. What are the benefits of being in the flow state of mind?
Creating art or doing other work is so easy that you think they are done automatically. You feel good and love life. Flow state is beneficial for physical and mental health.
3. How being outside can trigger the flow state of mind?
Being outside can be a potent trigger for states of flow where your mind quiets, and you find yourself more immersed in your sensory experience.
Sitting in nature silently, your mind becomes quiet, and your negative feelings like fear, worry, anger, and so on fade away. The civilized community loses its importance even if for a short time, and the glory of nature captures you. Mother Nature calls you, and if you learn how to listen, you'll receive your prize: the flow state of mind.",,

Hello! Question for practicing therapists: what apps do you use to support your clients in between sessions? any recommendations?,,
Am trying to keep smiling but is killing me in side,,
"What is creative joy?
I coined this name for a mood or a state of mind you have experienced more than once. Creative joy is the highest vibration you can reach in life. Suppose sadness, shame, or disappointment have the lowest frequencies among all human emotions, and laughter and love have the highest. In that case, the frequency of creative joy is on the same level or even more elevated than love. 
In Creative Joy, your mind knows no barriers and somehow floats higher than all that you used to consider your problems, so you are totally free from negativities like worry, shame, fear, anger, etc. As a result, you feel full of joy, happiness, and extraordinary capability, your every move is spontaneous, and you enjoy each moment ""without any reason."" Your senses and talents are sharper and to the point. In this state, what flashes through your mind will be manifested rapidly.
 Creative Joy is a mind's super arousal condition under subconscious control in which most artistic creations occur. It has been proven beneficial for physical and mental health and is an answer ""from the position of power"" to life!

 Although it occurs spontaneously in times when you fall in love or are super happy because of a success or a great situation, you can also generate it deliberately by doing the following steps:

    Practice putting yourself in a passionate mood about your work/study/loved person or any subject that is dear to you.
    Meditate regularly once or twice a day for at least 10 minutes.
    Surround yourself with a pleasing and calming environment, and choose your sensory input of the highest frequencies, like music, people, places, and whatever you see and hear. For example, following the news, watching murder movies, pass-time with low-frequency people, or being in an unpleasant place kills your Create Joy.
    Receive emotional feedback from one or more person/s who admire you and have the same goals and values that can be a friend or your social media followers or anyone else who has an emotional connection with you.  
    Pay attention to your physical conditions, don’t abuse your body by consuming too much alcohol or unhealthy foods or drugs or smoking or sitting for hours, and spend time in nature to get inspiration.
    Avoid distraction by unrelated time-consuming activities.",,

"Hello there everyone.
I have previously suffered from depression and recovered somewhat I think i have it again and my husband doesn't let me go to psychiatrist so I can get the right treatment and medication. He is an amazing person but not everyone is equipped to deal with someone who has a mental disorder.

Unfortunately, he does not know how to handle me when I experience the symptoms and just leaves me despite making promises that he will handle me. He has started to get aggressive and spiteful towards me too. Called me a liability. I've tried talking to him, and explaining but he is not listening.. Truth is, I am mentally blocked and cannot do anything other than finding ways to end my life when I have those intense phases. I've hurt myself thrice so far with whatever I had in my hands and I really hope that doesn't happen again. I've promised myself over n over again that I won't do it and I truly don't want to do this but when the phase of sadness and insecurity, vulnerability and apparent disregard comes from my perceived loved ones, it seems impossible to control myself.
Believe me I've tried all these is in the books, deep breathing, meditation, workouts.... Alll there is. 
I don't want to die and leave a mess for my loved ones behind. Can someone please help me and tell me what should I do?

For mental health experts, I am an INFJ on myers briggs test, 29 years old. Recently got married. I don't have any friends. Just my family and this is by choice as i prefer to read books.

"Hi,

After being diagnosed with Reactive Depression, I thought it may be helpful to say what's going on (it may help someone?).

My Doc explained to me what this was, and I was shocked!!! This is not something that happens overnight, it could take years for this to surface. In my case it was like a small snowball, getting bigger as years of pain, problems and other things made this snowball so big my mental emotions became a wreck and after a ""work colleague"" became the straw that broke the camel's back, my body couldn' take anymore.

So taking Docs advice, I started going to the gym, possible 6 to 12 months of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and other support has being given.

At first I felt so ashamed that this has happened and it still brings me to tears that I'm stuck in a dark place. Not totally sure what to say but talking to my Doc has put me on a path that I hope will help. Talking could help but we need to have the confidence and courage to take that step.

**So it's been a while since the above post, so I thought it might be worthwhile to give an update.

NHS CBT therapy has been amazing, lots of different techniques in calming the mind and body (this may or may not work for everyone but please try if offered). I've also taken advice from a private trainer (ex military) who has given me a gym workout and diet plan. Also I have removed myself from a toxic working environment and got myself a new job with a different company. 

What can I say.... I feel mentally and physically great. I'm still on medication, still working out at the gym and doing 2 Uni modules while improving my relationship with my wife and family. I'm enjoying the outdoors more by going for long walks and starting to enjoy going camping.

If anyone is in a dark place, shout out and seek help. Don't feel embarrassed or alone.... Please stay safe**",,

Help/ advice needed 

“So basically, a month or so ago, my partners dad died. I won't go into detail but he was a terrible man and he had no relationship with him for at least 11 years for the things his dad has done. When he died though he took it really bad. Lots came out about his dad which made it hard for him to feel like he could openly grieve especially to his family. 

He has been smoking weed which has been so bad for his mental health so just a few weeks ago stopped because we have children and I won't accept that as part of our family. 

2 weeks ago, he went on  week long fishing trip that was a holiday his dad had planned so it was passed on to him. He hated being there and came back even lower than before. 

This is the issue I'm looking for possible answers... 

He has been having pain in his stomach, the hospital said indigestion but he won't believe it. He has other urological problems and but I don't think its connected. When he has had anxiety and the last time he stopped smoking he had the same thing so I believe its the pain is psychological. 

Anyway, after spending 6 hours in hospital, he said as he was driving home, he got to a point where ""he lost it""he remembers thinking about making sure he drives slowly but he cannot remember driving 12 miles of his journey. He said it was like it took 2 seconds. 

Anyway, he past through the next town and said he pulled over and just lost control and just screamed in his car, ""you fxing cnt"" ""why why"" stuff like this. Screamed so much, then said it was like God spoke to him. He couldn't explain it without crying, he wouldn't look at me because he felt I would think he is crazy. He said it wasn't like a voice in his head, but it was overwhelming and he said it was like everything isn't complicated its so simple. He said it was like he heard every thought that anyone who ever existed said in that second. He said loads of other things, but he was so freaked out and he kept crying. None of this was explained to me in the order im explaining to you. 

He said he was also sick, he looked down and it was in his lap but he had no recollection of being sick, he said he thought he died. 

The next day he just said he doesn't want to talk about it because its embarrassing. He even thought maybe it was a seizure but I don't think so. 

Could this be a  dissociative episode? I've heard trauma can cause this but I can't find anything about it. He has been so low until today I called him and he seemed more himself. 

I think coming off smoking has caused some of this as he has always used it to mask his pain so last time he stopped it was 2 weeks of hell! 

Please does anyone had any ideas?? He won't talk to anyone xx”",,

"I expect you've seen many of posts about the depresion my health causes me but today I'm Just angry, the neurologist I saw 8 years ago diagnosed me with Functional Neurological Disorder kept saying it's psychological caused by stress and if i just believe in the diagnosis I would immediately recover despite it very clearly stating on the NHS FND is a non fatal disorder that is not a mental illness or caused by stress that can cause a wide range of Neurological problems but shows on no test or scans. 

He sent me to several psychologists and psychiatrists trying to get one to diagnose me with a mental illness he could blame it on. But now I found out he must have known the whole time he was saying it's just stress my nerves and brain was inflamed in an ""idiopathic episode"" when I was first went to hospital with the uncontrolled movements and other symptoms and part of my brain had been rendered ""non functioning"". 

I had an emergency appointment about my vision my optician referred me to about the Homonymous hemianopsia I have today and the Dr when diging in my medical records sayings ""it's pointless me being there it's as bad as can be saying I have idiopathic disorder that triggered an episode 8 years ago that caused the optic neuritis along with inflammation of my brain and nervous system that left one side of my occipital lobe permanently non functional causing a complete irreversible Homonymous hemianopsia as I have a brain injury from the episode.

That is a cart load of manure right there as clearly something must have been shown on tests or scans the neurolgist saw for today's doctor to know about the inflamation and damage to my occipital lobe which I knew nothing about. I'm still officially diagnosed with FND but now I don't know if something else wrong on top of what I know or I've been midiagnosed due to a truly incompetent neurolgist and other doctors not willing to investigate because of the idiopathic and FND diagnosis.",,

The answers the person gave to his fan was - ""i think that you should live your one life for yourself. within reason, you should do what you want to do."" 

This exchange hit too close to home since that's exactly my situation. Even after graduating university of what my parents (specially what my mom wanted which was languages since my dad's wish of engineering or law or anything like that was too difficult for me because I really struggled with that kind of sciences) wanted they're still not satisfied since I can't find a job with my degree or anywhere else (in my country it was difficult situation with employment as it was and COVID really made it almost impossible for young people to find a job or for someone to find different job) even though my mom tries to understand but still they would never let me continue dancing that I had to quit because of them and as they said it's enough to spend my time doing nonsense and focus and studies and get a real job that would pay my bills not just some BS - that was their words😔  and even though I've been dancing since childhood for many years professionally it's been almost 10 years since I was forced to stop dancing and it's been a hell of the time with mental health hitting the rock bottom, getting help and getting on medication that made me gain weight, then spending almost last two years after uni trying to focus on my health and on top of that through those years I lost my physical form and stamina since I didn't keep up or workout and now I'm 25 struggling to find a job (now I have one but it's a temporary one for 2 months but still it's better than nothing) still struggling with my mental health which is really a journey where some days I'm doing better and other days I wonder why I was born at all... it feels like I'm completely lost with no knowledge or plan of where to go or what I'm doing and what is my purpose and with the biggest regret of my life of leaving my one true love my one dream and passion which is dance and everything makes me think it's too late to pick up dancing again since I'm 25 and it will almost be as starting from zero (even though muscle memory it's still there I'm sure if I would be able to tap into it) and with nothing guaranteed what will happen 😔",,

I'm so glad that my ex-client (now a friend) has written about her life long struggles with mental health, from childhood trauma to conversion disorder to being told she'd never truly recover. This book is truly inspiring.

I'm also very proud to have been part of Karen's recovery where you can read a couple of chapters about the progress we made within our sessions together.

I may be biased but this is a truly honest and heart-felt account and will no doubt inspire others and help them realise there is always a way through the darkness. This book is proof of that.

"""The pain of doing nothing is far worse than the pain of doing something"". 

It's a bit like the thought of losing weight when your fearful of training, putting in the hours, grafting, experiencing the pain of applying effort and dedication. By doing nothing, remaining unfit, feeling fat, languished and depressed because your not getting on with it can be far, far worse on your mental health.

This applies to everything in life and everything you want to achieve. You'd be better off attacking your goals than doing nothing and feeling worse. Break the cycle.

What should you be doing? What are you fearing? What would you like to achieve? 

Time to start 'doing' instead of doing nothing.

"Can you help us make a difference locally? We need your support.

MindFixers is a not-for-profit organisation in Littlehampton, West Sussex created to provide low cost, quick and top quality solution for those seeking therapy and coaching. Part of the MindFixers solution is to provide a 12 hour programme spread over 6-8 weeks which is accessible to anyone and provides therapy and coaching for almost all common mental health issues.

The cost of an hour’s session is around 80% less than the average hourly rate for private therapy (and can often be free of charge). Accessibility is the key and MindFixers will enable thousands of people who would otherwise be denied therapy the ability to fix their mental issues, fast, quickly and expertly.

MindFixers has a dedicated mission: to enable each and every one of our clients to become an ‘informal coach’. What does this mean? The Programme will not only provide excellent therapy and a new way of thinking, but will also empower, provide much needed knowledge, enabling our clients to listen more intently, to avoid judgement and to encourage those in their peer groups to open up and talk. In essence, the mission of MindFixers is to influence as many people as possible to feel the freedom of being able to talk openly to their trusted peers. We believe the effect of this will begin to make a positive impact on society’s mental health issues and reverse the current upward trend of these issues as a whole.

Our main aims are;

• Provide socially inclusive therapy and coaching for all by making accessible.

• Reduce the stigma associated to mental health whilst empowering our clients with the knowledge to ‘pass it on'.

• Reduce the time it takes to access therapy and coaching when its needed most.

• Provide support for other much needed projects within the local community through localism.

For more information about MindFixers please go to our website at http://www.mindfixers.co.uk.

To get involved with our campaig please go to our campaigning page at http://www.mindfixers.co.uk/campaign/ where you will find information about how you can help spread the word in a few simple steps!",,

"Supporting people through the coronavirus pandemic.

Campaign.

WALK, TALK and SUPPORT: The Walking Therapist - 100 mile walk over 4 days - 3rd-6th April 2020

We are raising funds for MindFixers (www.mindfixers.co.uk) and for 2020, Beachy Head Chaplaincy Team, (as well as other mental health organisations for the Sussex and Hampshire regions). All donations will help make a huge impact on those that suffer the effects of poor mental health. (See the campaign at https://www.gofundme.com/f/walkandtalkcampaign). 

For the second year Steve McKeown, Personal Trainer Phil Burman, drummer Charlie Stanley from The Ordinary Boys and several other celebrities are walking from Eastbourne to Winchester, with several stops along the way including Petersfield, between 3rd and 6th April 2020 to offer support on the move and to raise funds for excellent Sussex-based causes as well as awareness for the growing mental health epidemic we are currently facing.

As in 2019, this is no ordinary walk because Steve and his team will be inviting people and celebrities to walk and talk about their own mental health issues, providing therapy and support along the way, making it available for those that need it most and for as far as their feet will take them.

""Our primary aim is to help remove the stigma associated with mental health and talking about it. Nobody should ever feel alone and isolated. We feel that fundraising for MindFixers and BHCT is the best place to start"", stated Steve.",,
"I am now excepting new video and telephone clients.

If you have an issue that is impacting your life and affecting your mental health or you simply want to improve the way you think and sharpen up. Give me a call for a free confidential chat.

Put 'you' first.

"Hi all,

For the last 3 months or so I have been asking the same question(s) day in, day out, no graphics, nothing other than words asking a questions. No long drawn out text to read, just straight to the point. I'm not here for the vanity other than to help in any way that I can. That's me. It's my life and its fortunately my career.

The most common questions I ask are;

""How has your day been?"" 

""How are you feeling tonight?"", 

""What's your day been like today?"".

They are all very simple questions, distractions away from normal life, reaching out. I try to answer every comment to show I am listening. I am here.

Everyone can do this, everyone has the same capacity to reach out. I've had some wonderful comments of reply, which I am so grateful of.

The moral behind my questioning is; if everyone asked similar questions we'd be much closer, much more integrated as a community. Maybe in your own way. That's not saying you can't be elaborate with graphics etc but keep it straight to the point.

Social media shouldn't just be about telling stories, the perfect snapshot of your life and many other scenarios. It's also about caring. 

As we become further disconnected to reallity and spend more time on communication tools such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc we need to learn how to demonstrate how we communicate in an entirely different way. Lockdown has been tough on everyone, isolation, loneliness, increased stress, mental health issues.

I now ask everyone to do the same, not necessarily a single post but maybe just a comment on someone else's wall.

You could make someone else's day!

"I've recently been interested in earthing or what's also known as grounding. It's quite simple, you earth your bed via a copper conduit rod hammered into the soil, run a conduit cable from the rod to your bedroom, connect the cable to the mattress via aluminium tape. I've tested connectivity via a multimeter and hey presto it's working. I am now ready to test the benefits. 

The health benefits of being grounded are phenomenal. Studies have shown that it can help with sleep, pain, cortisol levels, anxiety, depression and many other complaints. I thought I give it go as part of my research.

There are many scientific research studies that suggest that grounding is a real science. 

If your interested please watch the following documentary. I will update you on any progress.

MINDFIXERS - is a not-for-profit organisation created to provide a cheap, quick and top quality solution for those seeking therapy. Part of the MindFixers solution, MindFixers Programme, is a 12 hour programme spread over 6 weeks which is accessible by anyone and provides therapy for almost any mental condition.

The cost of an hour’s session is around 80% less than the average hourly rate for private therapy (and can often be free of charge). Accessibility is the key and MindFixers will enable thousands of people who would otherwise be denied therapy the ability to fix their mental issues, fast, quickly and expertly.

BEACHY HEAD CHAPLAINCY - is a valued search and rescue charity that seeks to save lives at Beachy Head, East Sussex.

The chaplains patrol on foot and by car and respond to emergency calls locating anyone at risk.

Using their skills in crisis intervention, they offer supportive listening to start a dialogue and to encourage more hopeful solutions than suicide.

They work alongside local services helping people to access support. 

PAVILLIONS - provides drug and alcohol services for adults in Brighton & Hove.
 
Support is available to anyone concerned about their drug or alcohol use, or to the families and carers supporting those struggling with substance misuse, irrespective of age, gender, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status or HIV status.

We have seen adults and children suffering from ADHD benefit tremendously from hemp oil, this is the first safe, organically grown, batch controlled, cold pressed and legal oil brought to South Africa which has been tested extensively that has none of the psychoactive ingredients of cannabis and totally safe to give to your children and to use yourself.

I have seen it work miracles on kids that had no focus and the ability to concentrate. It has none of the negative effects that canabis oil and THC has.  Please go to www.canamere.com/duplooy to read what this can do for you and your family! If you have any questions please let me know, or better yet join us for the next meeting","Thanks Cindy Du Plooy, I will check it out. Adrian Adrian Matthew From what I have learnt so far (I admit I am no scientist), hempseed oil is a great nutritional boost with the biggest value being attributed to easily absorbed Omega 3-I do feel better when drinking Biogen Omega 3 capsules up to 5000mg per day spread out, but more generally speaking hemp oil with CBD and THC (pure cannabis oil) is medicinally superior. The hempseed used for making legal oil do come from industrial application plants that have lower of those qualities and so I wonder if one should then take a lot more to have the medicinal effect it can offer. The problem with that is that the plant is a bio-accumulator which means that heavy metals are taken in by the plant while growing. As a lot of plant material is needed to make the oil, the additional elements are then also more concentrated than perhaps desired. The process of then 'purifying' the oil of said elements to safe numbers becomes an avenue worth scientifically investigated and I definately am trying. I was diagnosed with another condition recently that also affects memory so I am so confused about pretty much all of my symptoms. Until then, Concerta is definately not going anywhere and I will keep on emptying my pocket each month for my prescription!"

"Dear Parents 

 

Concentration is the master skill that affects everything that we do.  

 

The ability to concentrate is a secret element to success that often gets ignored. According to Daniel Goleman it is more important than IQ for determining school and career success.  

Within the context of school and university learners are required to concentrate and apply themselves in order to achieve results. Learners who are distracted and who are unable to bring their brains into focus usually struggle to reach their full potential.  

You can give your child an added advantage through neurofeedback training.  

 

The Brain 

The circuitry to concentrate is found in the area of the brain that governs executive functioning - the pre-frontal cortex. The attentional circuitry needs to have the experience of sustained episodes of concentration in order to build the mental models that create someone who can concentrate and perform optimally. In other words, we need to train the brain to increase concentration levels required to improve cognitive ability and keep it at enhanced levels for longer.  

 

Neurofeedback training 

Neurofeedback training uses cutting edge technology and it is non-invasive, drug free, safe and globally supported by extensive peer-reviewed literature. Research has proven that by increasing brain blood flow, significant clinical benefits are realised for many types of learning, cognitive, behaviour and neurological disorders. Because neurofeedback training positively impacts the frontal lobe, it can also provide for peak performance in sport and the corporate environment.   

Neurofeedback training enables the brain to actually growadditional cells and modify the functioning of existing cells. It does this through biofeedback training sessions. Just as a heart rate monitor assists you to train for fitness, so neurofeedback assists you to train your brain.  Through neurofeedback training, the brain creates additional neuropathways that assist with concentration, higher order thinking, decision making and behaviour regulation. In summary, by increasing blood flow to the frontal lobe, the brain is able to positively alter its structure.  

 

Who benefits from neurofeedback training? 

Every single person can benefit from neurofeedback training. In an age of distraction where our emotions are often scattered and our minds race from one thing to another we need to learn and practice concentration skills and strategies. We need to train our brains to be present and to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant. Neurofeedback training is for anyone who wants: 

• Better concentration skills 
• Higher productivity 
• Improved cognitive functioning 
• Mindfulness 
 

How do we operate? 

We assess learners on the TESCA (Test of Emotional Stability and Cognitive Ability).  The assessment will provide insight into your child’s concentration skills. It will measure: 

• Attention 
• Impulsivity 
• Accuracy 
• Response time 
• Variability 
These variables are used worldwide in scientific studies to measure cognitive performance.  

Where fallouts in concentration are noted a training protocol will be prescribed and where learners may benefit from peak performance training, such a training protocol will also be suggested. 

Should you wish to assist your child in harnessing their full potential, we encourage you to become involved in the exciting world of Neurofeedback training. 

We look forward to working with you and your child to achieve excellence.

I know the Journey of having kids with Adhd and having them in a normal everyday school 

My son’s life changed the moment when we decided to put him in a school that’s very caring and tolerate no bullying 
There’s only 10 children in a classrooms so everyone can get equal attention they also don’t require for the children to be on medication for me that’s brilliant 

From Grade 1 to 12

Because our children are very Creative and intelligent 

There’s only 30 open spots

"Good Morning Everyone.

First time in a long time I feel amazing. I think the meds are starting to take effect. I use to feel like I was never really present, like me life was out of focus constantly. I lived more in my thoughts than living life because my mind just never went quiet. I always felt tired, when I went to bed it was as if I'm half a awake the whole time, I wouldn't even dream for months on end. Resulting in me feeling constantly exhausted.

Since I started my meds I've been feeling more awake and this morning I feel here. My mind feels clearer than it has felt for a long time. Its like I've had really poor eye sight for a long time and finally got my Specs this morning. I just pray this is how it will always be when i'm on my meds and that I'm not just on some kind of temporary high. :-).

I hope you all are having better days since you have been diagnosed. I use to think I was just super lazy and weird and messed up, but since I've been diagnosed I feel understood and 'saved' in a sense.

So if you are having a bad day today, please know it wont always be that way and know there is hope whether with natural remedies or meds. Just stay hopeful and positive. Love you all and wishing you an amazing day.",What meds are you on?,

I can honestly say it's been life changing for my boy and us as a family. He's far, far happier and copes so much better on meds. We use high quality Broad-Spectrum oil drops which is a game changer. It took us a couple of days to get the Order and product information containing dosage was sent alongside. We stuck with it and I'm so glad we did. He's gone from being a sad lonely and very angry boy, to coping in school, improved focus which helps with concentration, having a small group of loyal friends and actually getting some enjoyment out of life. He sleeps better now and eats like a champ.
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't solve everything but it certainly has made life a whole lot more bearable and we don't get the huge meltdowns any more.

"Hi All! 

What’ll be the most affordable route of getting diagnosed as an adult? How does it work? How many sessions does one need & Does it really change anything if you do get diagnosed, if so - how, I mean is it really worth the time, effort and money?

After hours & hours of obsessively doing research it feels like I do tick some boxes.. I’ve been this way I am since I could remember and it feels so normal to me.. 

My worst traits are:
* I’m always late & miss deadlines and I hate it! Despite trying to plan accordingly.
* I procrastinate and leave everything to 99, get stressed and do a weeks worth of work in 1 evening.. obviously causing careless mistakes.
* I struggle to keep a set schedule
* Spaces out in conversations.
* I’m highly irritable and tend to react before I think..
* I always feel restless and on edge.
*  sleeping pattern, the norm is to sleep from 2am to 5:30/6:00am. 
* I’m easily distracted unless I’m stressed.
* Can’t stay committed to a hobby. 
* Annoyingly disorganised 
* Low selfesteem.
* excessive talker & fidgeting, but I don’t easily connect with people.
* Unnecessary overspending
*I’m very forgetful & I lose small things often
* struggle to stay motivated to do basic things.

Any and all advice will be highly appreciated!!🌻",GP is the starting point.

Iemand wat 'n mamma ook Kan Leer hoe om haar Wie kind te help.",Dr Aminah Bahm is uitstekend,"My son is diagnosed with severe ADHD, ASD, autism and has defiant behaviors which are very unbearable. Someone directed me to myco_ebby on IG. Now my son has been on the full spectrum THC free cbd gummies for about two months. No side effects. He eats like a champ and even sleeps great, there’s been improved focus and the meltdowns barely happen. It's worked really well for him. He says he feels better when he's on his gummies than when he's not and they last well over 8 hours, just in time for the second dose. Before that, we had tried Vyvanse and Strattera with poor results and lots of side effects. We get it from myco_ebby on insta, it’s worth a shot."

At first I just believed when he told me it bothered him and today he told by sister there was a baby spider that ran on his eye.

Had a few good cries and contemplate either praying it was a once off or searching help 😞

Is there anyone else whom had similar experience?",Mine do that also💔,

"Please may you give me some advice. 
My kid recently diagnosed with Adhd combination. She ￼was put on 5mg Ritalin for a month then the dr changed it to Neucon. I have no clue why. 
She is terrible on Neucon extremely emotional and not eating. 
She has only had 16 tablets of the Neucon so far, 
The Dr has now said let’s go back to 5mg Ritalin. 
My question is, is there a difference difference behaviour in short or LA Ritalin, he said we can look at LA later due to she sensitivity to the medication.  ￼I am feeling extremely confused and the Dr and pharmaceutical companies keep getting richer. 

I have to pay for a new script everytime and see the Dr every 4 months.","Natural Medication was a huge step for us. With hindsight I probably should have been braver and started it sooner. I can honestly say it's been life changing for my boy and us as a family. He's far, far happier and copes so much better on meds. We use high quality Broad-Spectrum oil drops which is a game changer. It took us a couple of days to get the Order and product information containing dosage was sent alongside. We stuck with it and I'm so glad we did. He's gone from being a sad lonely and very angry boy, to coping in school, improved focus which helps with concentration, having a small group of loyal friends and actually getting some enjoyment out of life. He sleeps better now and eats like a champ.
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't solve everything but it certainly has made life a whole lot more bearable and we don't get the huge meltdowns any more. He's in year 8 now and school have commented on how well he's doing. So far I'm struggling to see a down side. Reach out to health_space_247 in Insta, we get the best ones health related advice and recommendations from them. x",My girl didn't do well with the Ritalin and we are now on Concerta.... Long acting.... It's great
Prof Russell Barkley explaining how ADHD medication works:,,
So how does every adult on this group feel about paying for meds out of medical aid savings? I was told I need to go onto anti depressants because ADHD is not an adult issue. Can't wait to invite Adrian Gore. Thoughts?,"It is aweful. My anti depressants and mood stabilizers are covered under chronic meds, but I still pay cash or out of med savings for Concerta. Terribly depressing!",

Thank for adding me on the group. I have a 5 year old son we are not sure if he is ADHD  but his school thinks he is. We have been called twice to school to collect our son cause the teacher can not handle him so know he is seeing a OT at school and a educational therapist which will monitor him and then give us feedback on what is going to happen. We not sure what is going on and we as parents is so worried they say he can not complete a task in class he is all over the place talk all the time . We know he is a.very busy busy child but we tough it is normal as we always here boys is busy they will grow out of it. Is there any one who could maybe give me advice,"He's 5, he is not supposed to be able to sit still for a long time! Sorry, getting flashbacks from our struggle and my heart really goes out to all of you",my 5 year old son is ADHD and he is also the same and he is a very fussy eatr

"This group is focused on adult ADHD, I myself have been medicated  since 16 which has changed my life for the better. This is a forum for like minded individuals to share their thoughts.

Adrian Rugg",I was on medication as a kid had lots of side effects but it worked. Went of the medication as a teenager but now back on a herbal one trying it out. Pharmacist recommended it.,
This is a planner which helps me remember all my daily tasks. I put it behind the doors facing my bed so I immediately remember the next day what I need to do.,CNA has something like that as well. I got this one at some church org we were working on. I have an extra though.,Thanx will check at cna

"Understanding the reasons WHY concentration is an issue, makes it easier to address the problem.

"Went to see a psychologist today. She disturbs my explanation by always saying ""everybody goes through that"" and she explains something so long that I end up zoning out while she's explaining. And I still leave feeling misunderstood. That's why I don't like going to psychologists. And I need help, as I'm not coping....  I feel so frustrated!!!

I need a psychologist or coach who specializes in adult Adhd.",Brahh that's the same thing I go through .I always get misunderstood and it invalidate my struggles a lot. I honestly don't know what to do anymore,
"When you have a ""normal"" child, who gets good grades, you are happy. When he or she does as they are told, you are happy. But it is a ""normal"" joy, because, of course, it is his/her duty. But when you have a child with some limitations, with each learning and small success, you pulsate and vibrate as if you had won a championship... I would like to ask you a great favor on an important subject:
It is the Special Education week, for children with Cerebral Palsy, Down syndrome, Autism, Dyslexia, ADHD (attention deficit, with and without hyperactivity). For all children with special needs who struggle every day to succeed, and those who try to help them.
It would be great to teach our children to be kind and to accept all their classmates. Children with special needs are not strangers. They want what every kid wants: to be accepted! And they suffer greatly when they are rejected or mocked.
Can I make you a request? Copy and paste this message in honor of all children who are UNIQUE, but different! Let's see who has a strong heart? Please do not share. Copy and paste. Believe it or not, special children and their parents need lots of help!",,
,Does this pens help children yo concentrate?,No that’s just wrong
,I did when I was younger but those days have past. I am more concerned with the fact that medical Aids do not view ADHD has a condition that affects adults. 😂😂😂. Come May every year I am straight into the self payment gap,Yeah they use cover the meds for adhd now they don't n they are so expensive

"Living with ADHD

I worry about everything all the time
Sometimes I forget to call her 
Not that I want to because to
My mind feels like a Child locked in a Crazy store warehouse without cameras
I have a diary which I forget where it is.
I'm organised in a mess 24 hrs
I love me so much the same way I hate my mistakes.
I think in high frequency like a super car on a freeway my thought is unstoppable
I fight my thoughts all the time
I want to be alone with everybody around me.
When I hurt I cry even in public
Suicidal but rich in life
I know everything but hard to use
The same knowledge
Im the guy whom plays with the dog at an invited party
I lose stuff all the time
Dammit where's my wallet again mxm
I want to dance wait no actually scream maybe while dancing mix it up with some laughter then let me cry while at it.
I'm paranoid about the future past and present
Let me fidget till I can't feel my hands
Let me fidget till my knee is numb
Just spilt a drink on My white pants as I type this.
Don't scream or call me crazy 
Cause this is my blessing and my curse.",One day he will understand,Gosh this is so beautifully written.

Any suggestion to natural suplement to boost serotonin?,,
"As a Neurofeedback Practitioner, I am always stunned by the number of Grade 1 parents contacting us for help early in their child’s grade 1 year. So many of the parents tell us that the teachers identified that the child cannot concentrate. When asked, more often than not, parents indicate that a lack of concentration was never an issue before. So why now?

In South Africa, by law, children should go to Grade 1 the year in which they turn seven – thus creating the impression that age determines school readiness. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as that! We should not only gauge a child’s readiness for school by his or her age. Children vary greatly in their levels of emotional maturity. This is partly influenced by parenting but also depends on the natural, biological developmental process and the environmental stimulus. Therefore, the child’s overall development should be considered. Some developmental milestones are easy to observe, but others are much more subtle. Undetected, these underdeveloped skills could lead to academic and social issues later in the child’s school.

So, what should we consider?
When we talk about development, we should look at the different aspects thereof:

emotional
social
physical
intellectual
language development
These are broad terms… not always easily observed and understood. Let me break it down for you, identifying a few traits to look out for:

Confidence. Is your child confident enough to speak up when he/she is uncomfortable or needs help? In the daunting larger Grade 1 environment, children need to be able to let the teacher know when they need a bathroom break, are feeling ill, do not have the right tools or are being bullied.

 Separation. Drama dropping off your child at school? Some crying in the first few weeks is normal. However, teachers simply don’t have the capacity to console a tearful child all day long. Sitting next to your child in the grade 1 class during school hours should not be an option.

 Responsibility. Can your child look after his/her ‘stuff’? Do lunchboxes come back home at the end of the day, or do you need to buy new ones on a weekly basis?

 Concentration. Oh! This one is a tough one! Is your child able to sit still, at a table and concentrate for relatively long periods at a time? Remember in nursery school children move a lot! A grade 1 child is expected to sit still and work – a lot!

 Problem solving. Can your child solve little problems as the day goes on? Forgot a ruler – borrow one; lost a school jersey – go to the lost property box.

 Independence. Can your child complete most tasks on his/her own or is he/she constantly running to his teacher’s table for approval or intervention?

 Persistence. Is “I can’t” the norm with your child?

A School Readiness Assessment provides a baseline of your child's current level of ability in the specific areas which equips them to cope with formal learning situations. It is therefore invaluable to you as the parent and to your child's teacher, regarding their strengths and the areas in which attention is still required before they make the transition to Grade 1.

Brain Gain is equipped and geared to provide parents with a unique School Readiness Assessment which evaluates the child's cognitive and physical development, as well as his/her ability to concentrate. When the assessment highlights areas of concern, parents receive a customised activity pack which can be used at home with your child to have fun practicing skills to develop the problem areas.",Do you accept medical aid?,

"My ADHD brain...

Me: I fancy a cuppa
*Fills up kettle and turns on*
Brain: Why don't we wash some dishes whilst we're in the kitchen? 
*Starts washing dishes and forgets about kettle*
Half an hour later ...
Me: Wait a minute I was making a cuppa.
*Turns on kettle, gets out mug*
Brain: Don't forget to give the rabbits their food.
*Goes to feed rabbits*
Half an hour later ...
Me: Darn my cuppa!
*Turns on kettle, puts in teabag*
Brain: Whilst we're waiting let's go get that stuff out your bag*
Half an hour later ...
Me: FFS my cuppa! Brain you are not defeating me this time!!
*Puts on kettle and stares at it until boiled. FINALLY makes cuppa*
Me: Ahhh finally! Let's sit down and read my magazine with my cuppa.
Half an hour later ...
Me: *sigh* Cold tea it is then.

"17 Things Your ADHD Child Would Tell You if He Could

1) I'm trying way harder than you’ll ever know even though it doesn’t seem like it to you. I really, truly am.

2) Criticizing me or getting angry at me that my brain doesn’t work better doesn’t help me. It makes me hate myself even more.

3) I’m painfully aware of all the areas that I’m not measuring up. Instead of making a big deal about my shortcomings, try to find ways to help me.

4) An accommodation isn’t the same as enabling. If you help me where I’m genuinely struggling, I’m going to be grateful. Don’t assume that I’m manipulating you.

5) I’m not doing this to you; it’s not something I am doing on purpose.

6) If you think it’s hard to live with me, imagine trying to live inside a body that won’t do what you want it to do.

7) My brain doesn’t work right but I don’t know how to tell you that. It makes me angry and unkind, but I’m not trying to be that way.

8) When I’m being horrible, what I really need is for you to tell me you’ll love me no matter what. And maybe hug me, too. I probably believe that I’m unlovable, so prove me wrong.

9) I know that my lack of motivation is frustrating, but pushing harder doesn’t help me do better.

10) My anger and frustration is a result of my brain not processing properly. When I’m overwhelmed and freaking out, don’t escalate by freaking out or getting angry too. I need you to be calm and show me that everything’s going to be fine even when I feel like it’s not.

11) If I get overwhelmed, don’t expect me to sort out the problem all by myself. The part of my brain the controls regulation doesn’t work properly. That’s why I need your help to regulate.

12) Don’t try to break me of things that you see as weaknesses. My sensitivity as a child means I’ll be compassionate as an adult. My stubbornness as a child means I’ll be independent and assertive as an adult. Instead of squashing these characteristics, channel them toward something good that can benefit me when I’m older. Don’t view me as something that needs fixed or toughened-up.

13) Don’t be afraid of labeling me. A label gives me answers and help. If my condition is serious enough to need to be diagnosed, you can guarantee that I’ve noticed something’s wrong and I’m wondering why I’m different too. Unless you tell me what’s going on, I’m likely to grow up angry and confused about why everyone has it all together and I don’t. A label means I can get help; it gives me answers and vindication.

14) I have a real, actual medical condition in my brain. It’s just as real as if I had Type 1 Diabetes. Just like Diabetes, I need help to deal with the condition. No one tells someone with Type 1 Diabetes that they are lazy if they’re tired because their blood sugar is low. They understand that it’s part of the condition. Please, please, please learn about my condition, and don’t blame me for things that are out of my control. Just like leaving Type 1 Diabetes untreated results in serious complications and even death, untreated ADHD can lead to serious complications –potentially including death. Thankfully, there are many ways to treat ADHD (and medication isn’t the only way).

15) My frontal lobe is developing 30% behind normal. Please understand this and don’t put me in situations I’m not ready to handle. If you give me responsibility that’s beyond my developmental age, don’t be angry with me that I do poorly. That’s setting me up for failure, and that’s just cruel.

16) Stop expecting me to be normal. I can’t be. Not for all my trying. Until you accept that, I’ll always be a failure in your eyes, and I’ll always view myself as not good enough.

17) You have the power to make me miserable by how you treat me. Remember to treat me with love and grace. Treat me how you would want to be treated if you were struggling with a problem in your brain. I may make myself miserable sometimes, but don’t add to that by treating me poorly. When in doubt, be kind. Believe me, I need your kindness.",Love this. Well written.,😭😭
