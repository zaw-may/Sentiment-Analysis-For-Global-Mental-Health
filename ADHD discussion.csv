* I struggle to keep a set schedule
* Spaces out in conversations.
* I‚Äôm highly irritable and tend to react before I think..
* I always feel restless and on edge.

* I‚Äôm easily distracted unless I‚Äôm stressed.
* Can‚Äôt stay committed to a hobby. 
* Annoyingly disorganised 
* Low selfesteem.
* excessive talker & fidgeting, but I don‚Äôt easily connect with people.

There is no pressure to complete the survey I am just looking to gather more participants and consider a global perspective- including South Africa before I close the survey! 

Do you have ADHD? Did you experience online learning during Covid? 

If so, please fill out this short survey:

1) I'm trying way harder than you‚Äôll ever know even though it doesn‚Äôt seem like it to you. I really, truly am.

2) Criticizing me or getting angry at me that my brain doesn‚Äôt work better doesn‚Äôt help me. It makes me hate myself even more.

3) I‚Äôm painfully aware of all the areas that I‚Äôm not measuring up. Instead of making a big deal about my shortcomings, try to find ways to help me.

4) An accommodation isn‚Äôt the same as enabling. If you help me where I‚Äôm genuinely struggling, I‚Äôm going to be grateful. Don‚Äôt assume that I‚Äôm manipulating you.

5) I‚Äôm not doing this to you; it‚Äôs not something I am doing on purpose.

6) If you think it‚Äôs hard to live with me, imagine trying to live inside a body that won‚Äôt do what you want it to do.

7) My brain doesn‚Äôt work right but I don‚Äôt know how to tell you that. It makes me angry and unkind, but I‚Äôm not trying to be that way.

8) When I‚Äôm being horrible, what I really need is for you to tell me you‚Äôll love me no matter what. And maybe hug me, too. I probably believe that I‚Äôm unlovable, so prove me wrong.

9) I know that my lack of motivation is frustrating, but pushing harder doesn‚Äôt help me do better.

10) My anger and frustration is a result of my brain not processing properly. When I‚Äôm overwhelmed and freaking out, don‚Äôt escalate by freaking out or getting angry too. I need you to be calm and show me that everything‚Äôs going to be fine even when I feel like it‚Äôs not.

11) If I get overwhelmed, don‚Äôt expect me to sort out the problem all by myself. The part of my brain the controls regulation doesn‚Äôt work properly. That‚Äôs why I need your help to regulate.

12) Don‚Äôt try to break me of things that you see as weaknesses. My sensitivity as a child means I‚Äôll be compassionate as an adult. My stubbornness as a child means I‚Äôll be independent and assertive as an adult. Instead of squashing these characteristics, channel them toward something good that can benefit me when I‚Äôm older. Don‚Äôt view me as something that needs fixed or toughened-up.

13) Don‚Äôt be afraid of labeling me. A label gives me answers and help. If my condition is serious enough to need to be diagnosed, you can guarantee that I‚Äôve noticed something‚Äôs wrong and I‚Äôm wondering why I‚Äôm different too. Unless you tell me what‚Äôs going on, I‚Äôm likely to grow up angry and confused about why everyone has it all together and I don‚Äôt. A label means I can get help; it gives me answers and vindication.

14) I have a real, actual medical condition in my brain. It‚Äôs just as real as if I had Type 1 Diabetes. Just like Diabetes, I need help to deal with the condition. No one tells someone with Type 1 Diabetes that they are lazy if they‚Äôre tired because their blood sugar is low. They understand that it‚Äôs part of the condition. Please, please, please learn about my condition, and don‚Äôt blame me for things that are out of my control. Just like leaving Type 1 Diabetes untreated results in serious complications and even death, untreated ADHD can lead to serious complications ‚Äìpotentially including death. Thankfully, there are many ways to treat ADHD (and medication isn‚Äôt the only way).

15) My frontal lobe is developing 30% behind normal. Please understand this and don‚Äôt put me in situations I‚Äôm not ready to handle. If you give me responsibility that‚Äôs beyond my developmental age, don‚Äôt be angry with me that I do poorly. That‚Äôs setting me up for failure, and that‚Äôs just cruel.

16) Stop expecting me to be normal. I can‚Äôt be. Not for all my trying. Until you accept that, I‚Äôll always be a failure in your eyes, and I‚Äôll always view myself as not good enough.

17) You have the power to make me miserable by how you treat me. Remember to treat me with love and grace. Treat me how you would want to be treated if you were struggling with a problem in your brain. I may make myself miserable sometimes, but don‚Äôt add to that by treating me poorly. When in doubt, be kind. Believe me, I need your kindness.",8,,7

1,2018-02-21T11:23:57.000Z,Do you accept medical aid?,,,,,,"As a Neurofeedback Practitioner, I am always stunned by the number of Grade 1 parents contacting us for help early in their child‚Äôs grade 1 year. So many of the parents tell us that the teachers identified that the child cannot concentrate. When asked, more often than not, parents indicate that a lack of concentration was never an issue before. So why now?

In South Africa, by law, children should go to Grade 1 the year in which they turn seven ‚Äì thus creating the impression that age determines school readiness. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as that! We should not only gauge a child‚Äôs readiness for school by his or her age. Children vary greatly in their levels of emotional maturity. This is partly influenced by parenting but also depends on the natural, biological developmental process and the environmental stimulus. Therefore, the child‚Äôs overall development should be considered. Some developmental milestones are easy to observe, but others are much more subtle. Undetected, these underdeveloped skills could lead to academic and social issues later in the child‚Äôs school.

So, what should we consider?
When we talk about development, we should look at the different aspects thereof:

emotional
social
physical
intellectual
language development
These are broad terms‚Ä¶ not always easily observed and understood. Let me break it down for you, identifying a few traits to look out for:

Confidence. Is your child confident enough to speak up when he/she is uncomfortable or needs help? In the daunting larger Grade 1 environment, children need to be able to let the teacher know when they need a bathroom break, are feeling ill, do not have the right tools or are being bullied.

ÔÇß Separation. Drama dropping off your child at school? Some crying in the first few weeks is normal. However, teachers simply don‚Äôt have the capacity to console a tearful child all day long. Sitting next to your child in the grade 1 class during school hours should not be an option.

ÔÇß Responsibility. Can your child look after his/her ‚Äòstuff‚Äô? Do lunchboxes come back home at the end of the day, or do you need to buy new ones on a weekly basis?

ÔÇß Concentration. Oh! This one is a tough one! Is your child able to sit still, at a table and concentrate for relatively long periods at a time? Remember in nursery school children move a lot! A grade 1 child is expected to sit still and work ‚Äì a lot!

ÔÇß Problem solving. Can your child solve little problems as the day goes on? Forgot a ruler ‚Äì borrow one; lost a school jersey ‚Äì go to the lost property box.

ÔÇß Independence. Can your child complete most tasks on his/her own or is he/she constantly running to his teacher‚Äôs table for approval or intervention?

ÔÇß Persistence. Is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äù the norm with your child?

A School Readiness Assessment provides a baseline of your child's current level of ability in the specific areas which equips them to cope with formal learning situations. It is therefore invaluable to you as the parent and to your child's teacher, regarding their strengths and the areas in which attention is still required before they make the transition to Grade 1.

Brain Gain is equipped and geared to provide parents with a unique School Readiness Assessment which evaluates the child's cognitive and physical development, as well as his/her ability to concentrate. When the assessment highlights areas of concern, parents receive a customised activity pack which can be used at home with your child to have fun practicing skills to develop the problem areas.",3,,7

Concentration is the master skill that affects everything that we do.  

 

The ability to concentrate is a secret element to success that often gets ignored. According to Daniel Goleman it is more important than IQ for determining school and career success.  

Within the context of school and university learners are required to concentrate and apply themselves in order to achieve results. Learners who are distracted and who are unable to bring their brains into focus usually struggle to reach their full potential.  

You can give your child an added advantage through neurofeedback training.  

 

The Brain 

The circuitry to concentrate is found in the area of the brain that governs executive functioning - the pre-frontal cortex. The attentional circuitry needs to have the experience of sustained episodes of concentration in order to build the mental models that create someone who can concentrate and perform optimally. In other words, we need to train the brain to increase concentration levels required to improve cognitive ability and keep it at enhanced levels for longer.  

 

Neurofeedback training 

Neurofeedback training uses cutting edge technology and it is non-invasive, drug free, safe and globally supported by extensive peer-reviewed literature. Research has proven that by increasing brain blood flow, significant clinical benefits are realised for many types of learning, cognitive, behaviour and neurological disorders. Because neurofeedback training positively impacts the frontal lobe, it can also provide for peak performance in sport and the corporate environment.   

Neurofeedback training enables the brain to actually growadditional cells and modify the functioning of existing cells. It does this through biofeedback training sessions. Just as a heart rate monitor assists you to train for fitness, so neurofeedback assists you to train your brain.  Through neurofeedback training, the brain creates additional neuropathways that assist with concentration, higher order thinking, decision making and behaviour regulation. In summary, by increasing blood flow to the frontal lobe, the brain is able to positively alter its structure.  

 

Who benefits from neurofeedback training? 

Every single person can benefit from neurofeedback training. In an age of distraction where our emotions are often scattered and our minds race from one thing to another we need to learn and practice concentration skills and strategies. We need to train our brains to be present and to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant. Neurofeedback training is for anyone who wants: 

‚Ä¢ Better concentration skills 
‚Ä¢ Higher productivity 
‚Ä¢ Improved cognitive functioning 
‚Ä¢ Mindfulness 
 

How do we operate? 

We assess learners on the TESCA (Test of Emotional Stability and Cognitive Ability).  The assessment will provide insight into your child‚Äôs concentration skills. It will measure: 

‚Ä¢ Attention 
‚Ä¢ Impulsivity 
‚Ä¢ Accuracy 
‚Ä¢ Response time 
‚Ä¢ Variability 
These variables are used worldwide in scientific studies to measure cognitive performance.  

Where fallouts in concentration are noted a training protocol will be prescribed and where learners may benefit from peak performance training, such a training protocol will also be suggested. 

Should you wish to assist your child in harnessing their full potential, we encourage you to become involved in the exciting world of Neurofeedback training. 

We look forward to working with you and your child to achieve excellence.

I have changed his diet and dissipline is much stricter as advised by therapist and teacher. But getting him do do his work at school is exhausting for both me and the teacher. It is not that he does not have the ability because it is stuff that he knows. I have tried everything i can think of but nothing works.

0,,,,,,,,"When you have a ""normal"" child, who gets good grades, you are happy. When he or she does as they are told, you are happy. But it is a ""normal"" joy, because, of course, it is his/her duty. But when you have a child with some limitations, with each learning and small success, you pulsate and vibrate as if you had won a championship... I would like to ask you a great favor on an important subject:
It is the Special Education week, for children with Cerebral Palsy, Down syndrome, Autism, Dyslexia, ADHD (attention deficit, with and without hyperactivity). For all children with special needs who struggle every day to succeed, and those who try to help them.
It would be great to teach our children to be kind and to accept all their classmates. Children with special needs are not strangers. They want what every kid wants: to be accepted! And they suffer greatly when they are rejected or mocked.
Can I make you a request? Copy and paste this message in honor of all children who are UNIQUE, but different! Let's see who has a strong heart? Please do not share. Copy and paste. Believe it or not, special children and their parents need lots of help!",0,,5

7,2017-04-06T08:05:55.000Z,What meds are you on?,,,,,,"Good Morning Everyone.

First time in a long time I feel amazing. I think the meds are starting to take effect. I use to feel like I was never really present, like me life was out of focus constantly. I lived more in my thoughts than living life because my mind just never went quiet. I always felt tired, when I went to bed it was as if I'm half a awake the whole time, I wouldn't even dream for months on end. Resulting in me feeling constantly exhausted.

Since I started my meds I've been feeling more awake and this morning I feel here. My mind feels clearer than it has felt for a long time. Its like I've had really poor eye sight for a long time and finally got my Specs this morning. I just pray this is how it will always be when i'm on my meds and that I'm not just on some kind of temporary high. :-).

I hope you all are having better days since you have been diagnosed. I use to think I was just super lazy and weird and messed up, but since I've been diagnosed I feel understood and 'saved' in a sense.

So if you are having a bad day today, please know it wont always be that way and know there is hope whether with natural remedies or meds. Just stay hopeful and positive. Love you all and wishing you an amazing day.",0,,7

I worry about everything all the time
Sometimes I forget to call her 
Not that I want to because to
My mind feels like a Child locked in a Crazy store warehouse without cameras
I have a diary which I forget where it is.
I'm organised in a mess 24 hrs
I love me so much the same way I hate my mistakes.
I think in high frequency like a super car on a freeway my thought is unstoppable
I fight my thoughts all the time
I want to be alone with everybody around me.
When I hurt I cry even in public
Suicidal but rich in life
I know everything but hard to use
The same knowledge
Im the guy whom plays with the dog at an invited party
I lose stuff all the time
Dammit where's my wallet again mxm
I want to dance wait no actually scream maybe while dancing mix it up with some laughter then let me cry while at it.
I'm paranoid about the future past and present
Let me fidget till I can't feel my hands
Let me fidget till my knee is numb
Just spilt a drink on My white pants as I type this.
Don't scream or call me crazy 
Cause this is my blessing and my curse.",1,,8

Adrian Adrian Matthew From what I have learnt so far (I admit I am no scientist), hempseed oil is a great nutritional boost with the biggest value being attributed to easily absorbed Omega 3-I do feel better when drinking Biogen Omega 3 capsules up to 5000mg per day spread out, but more generally speaking hemp oil with CBD and THC (pure cannabis oil) is medicinally superior. The hempseed used for making legal oil do come from industrial application plants that have lower of those qualities and so I wonder if one should then take a lot more to have the medicinal effect it can offer. The problem with that is that the plant is a bio-accumulator which means that heavy metals are taken in by the plant while growing. As a lot of plant material is needed to make the oil, the additional elements are then also more concentrated than perhaps desired. The process of then 'purifying' the oil of said elements to safe numbers becomes an avenue worth scientifically investigated and I definately am trying. I was diagnosed with another condition recently that also affects memory so I am so confused about pretty much all of my symptoms. Until then, Concerta is definately not going anywhere and I will keep on emptying my pocket each month for my prescription!","Thank you for adding me to the group. Hi Members, I wanted to bring a revolutionary product to your attention. We have seen adults and children suffering from ADHD benefit tremendously from hemp oil, this is the first safe, organically grown, batch controlled, cold pressed and legal oil brought to South Africa which has been tested extensively that has none of the psychoactive ingredients of cannabis and totally safe to give to your children and to use yourself. Please let me know if you are interested to read more about the product, or would like to come to a meeting.",0,Home of Endocannabinoid Health,1
